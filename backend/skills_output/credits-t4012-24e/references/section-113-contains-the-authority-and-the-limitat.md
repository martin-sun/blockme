## Line 320 - Deduction of Taxable Dividends

### Legal Authority and Limitations
- **Section 113**: Governs deductions for dividends received from foreign affiliates
- **Subsection 138(6)**: Authorizes life insurers to deduct taxable dividends received from taxable Canadian corporations (excluding dividends on term preferred shares acquired in ordinary business operations)

### Implementation
Enter the total amount of taxable dividends deductible in calculating taxable income on line 320. This amount represents the total from column 240 of Schedule 3.

### Important Notes
- Stock dividends received from non-resident corporations are excluded from this deduction
- By deducting taxable dividends from net income/loss (line 300), you may create or increase a non-capital loss for the year

### Example
A corporation receives $50,000 in taxable dividends from a foreign affiliate and $30,000 from a Canadian corporation. If both amounts qualify under the respective sections, the corporation would enter $80,000 on line 320.

### Reference

## Line 325 - Part VI.1 Tax Deduction

### Eligibility
Corporations that pay Part VI.1 tax on dividends paid on:
- Taxable preferred shares
- Short-term preferred shares

### Calculation
Deduct 3.5 times the Part VI.1 tax payable:
```
Line 325 Amount = Part VI.1 Tax × 3.5
```

### Example
If a corporation pays $10,000 in Part VI.1 tax, the deductible amount on line 325 would be $35,000 ($10,000 × 3.5).

### Reference
Paragraph 110(1)(k)

## Line 331 - Non-capital Losses of Previous Tax Years

### Application
Enter non-capital losses carried forward from previous years to reduce taxable income from line 130 of Schedule 4.

### Implementation Steps
1. Enter current-year non-capital losses on line 330 of Schedule 3
2. Enter previous years' non-capital losses used to reduce dividends subject to Part IV tax on line 335
3. Enter the total of these amounts as an applied amount on line 135 of Schedule 4

### Example
A corporation has $20,000 in current-year non-capital losses and $15,000 in carried forward losses from previous years. The corporation would enter $15,000 on line 331 (assuming $20,000 is applied to current year income).

### References
Paragraphs 111(1)(a), 186(1)(c), and 186(1)(d)

## Line 332 - Net-capital Losses of Previous Tax Years

### Application
Enter net capital losses from previous years applied against taxable capital gains incurred in the current year.

### Calculation
```
Line 332 Amount = Capital Loss (Schedule 4, line 225) × 50%
```

### Important Note
A net capital loss can create a non-capital loss in the year applied, as it reduces taxable capital gains rather than being limited to reducing taxable income.

### Example
A corporation has $40,000 in net capital losses from previous years and $30,000 in taxable capital gains in the current year. The corporation can apply $30,000 of the losses against the gains, resulting in a line 332 entry of $15,000 ($30,000 × 50%).

## Line 333 - Restricted Farm Losses of Previous Tax Years

### Application
Enter restricted farm losses from previous years to reduce current-year farm income.

### Implementation
1. Enter the amount on line 333
2. Enter the amount of restricted farm loss used on line 430 of Schedule 4

### Example
A corporation with $25,000 in restricted farm losses from previous years and $20,000 in current-year farm income would enter $20,000 on line 333.

### Reference
Paragraph 111(1)(c)

## Line 334 - Farm Losses of Previous Tax Years

### Application
Enter farm losses carried forward from previous years to reduce taxable income from line 330 of Schedule 4.

### Implementation Steps
1. Enter current-year farm loss on line 340 of Schedule 3
2. Enter previous years' farm losses used to reduce dividends subject to Part IV tax on line 345
3. Enter the total of these amounts on line 335 of Schedule 4 as the amount applied

### Example
A corporation has $30,000 in current-year farm losses and $20,000 in carried forward farm losses. If $15,000 of the carried forward losses are used to reduce dividends subject to Part IV tax, the corporation would enter $5,000 on line 334 ($20,000 - $15,000).

## Line 335 - Limited Partnership Losses of Previous Tax Years

### Application
Enter the deductible amount of limited partnership losses from previous years applied against other incomes in the current year.

### Implementation
The amount should be derived from Part 7 of Schedule 4.

### Example
A corporation has $10,000 in limited partnership losses from previous years and applies the full amount against other income in the current year. The corporation would enter $10,000 on line 335.

### Reference

## Line 340 - Taxable Capital Gains or Taxable Dividends Allocated from a Central Credit Union

### Eligibility
Available to member credit unions when a central credit union has made an election under subsection 137(5.1).

### Application
Member credit unions can claim amounts allocated as:
- Taxable dividends
- Net non-taxable capital gains

These amounts are deductible from taxable income under paragraph 137(5.2)(c).

### Example
A member credit union receives $50,000 in taxable dividends and $30,000 in net non-taxable capital gains from its central credit union. The credit union would enter $80,000 on line 340.

## Line 350 - Prospector's and Grubstaker's Shares

### Eligibility
Available for shares received from a corporation in exchange for disposition of an interest in a mining property (unless exempt under a tax treaty).

### Calculation
1. Initial receipt: Deduct 1/2 of the value of shares received
2. Upon disposition or exchange: Deduct 1/2 of the lesser of:
   - Fair market value of shares at time of disposition of mining property
   - Fair market value of shares at time of disposition or exchange of shares

### Example
A corporation receives shares valued at $100,000 in exchange for disposition of a mining property. The initial deduction would be $50,000 ($100,000 × 1/2). If the shares are later disposed of when their fair market value is $80,000, the additional deduction would be $40,000 ($80,000 × 1/2).

### Employer Deduction

### Notification Requirements

2. CRA notification: File Schedule 59, Information Return for Non-Qualified Securities, with T2 return

### Example
An employee receives stock options with a benefit of $50,000, but they exceed the $200,000 annual limit and are deemed non-qualified. The employer can claim a $50,000 deduction on line 352.

## Line 355 - Section 110.5 Additions or Subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) Additions

### Application

This amount forms part of the non-capital loss.
