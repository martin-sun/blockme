Corp X claimed the small business deduction when calculating federal tax payable.\n\n- Income from active business carried on in Canada: $78,000\n- Newfoundland and Labrador lower rate: 2.5%\n- Newfoundland and Labrador higher rate: 15%\n\n**Calculation:**\n```\nTaxable income: $90,000\nSubtract amount taxed at lower rate: $78,000\nAmount taxed at higher rate: $12,000\n\nTaxes payable at lower rate: $78,000 × 2.5% = $1,950\nTaxes payable at higher rate: $12,000 × 15% = $1,800\nNewfoundland and Labrador tax payable: $3,750\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Multi-Provincial Allocation\n\nCorp Y has permanent establishments in both Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut. Tax year: January 1 to December 31, 2024. Corp Y claimed the small business deduction when calculating federal tax payable.\n\n- Newfoundland and Labrador lower rate: 2.5%\n- Newfoundland and Labrador higher rate: 15%\n\n**Newfoundland and Labrador Calculation:**\n```\nTaxable income allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador: $60,000\nTaxable income allocated to Nunavut: $30,000\nTotal taxable income earned in Canada: $90,000\nFederal small business deduction amount: $78,000\n\nIncome eligible for federal small business deduction attributed to Newfoundland and Labrador:\n$60,000 × $78,000 ÷ $90,000 = $52,000\n\nTaxable income earned in Newfoundland and Labrador: $60,000\nSubtract: Income eligible for small business deduction attributed to NL: $52,000\nAmount taxed at higher rate: $8,000\n\nTaxes payable at higher rate: $8,000 × 15% = $1,200\nTaxes payable at lower rate: $52,000 × 2.5% = $1,300\nNewfoundland and Labrador tax payable: $2,500\n```\n\nTo calculate Nunavut income tax payable, Corp Y would repeat the same steps using Nunavut's rates.\n\n### Provincial and Territorial Foreign Tax Credits\n\nEvery province and territory allows corporations to claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to another country on foreign non-business income. This credit reduces provincial tax otherwise payable.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Cannot claim foreign tax credits for Quebec and Alberta on the federal return (these provinces collect their own income taxes)\n- Credit is available only if foreign non-business income tax paid exceeds the federal foreign non-business income tax credit deductible for the year\n- For each province/territory claiming a credit, complete a separate calculation\n- For each foreign country paid to, complete a separate calculation\n- When dual rates apply, use the higher rate when calculating the foreign tax credit (for Ontario, use the basic rate)\n\n**Eligibility Criteria:**\n- Resident in Canada throughout the tax year\n- Has a permanent establishment in the province or territory at any time during the tax year\n- Has foreign investment income for the tax year\n\n**Special Ontario Rule:**\nAn authorized foreign bank is eligible for the foreign tax credit if it performed Canadian banking business.\n\n**Implementation Note:**\nIf the tax rate changed during the tax year, prorate the calculation in Part 9 of Schedule 21 using the number of days in each period. For British Columbia, prorate the tax rate in each period, round to the nearest one-thousandth of one percent (0.001%), and add the rounded percentages before multiplying by foreign non-business income.\n\nTo claim the foreign tax credit, complete Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit.\n\n### Provincial and Territorial Credits by Province\n\n#### Newfoundland and Labrador\n\n**Tax Rates:**\n- Lower rate: 2.5% (effective January 1, 2024, decreased from 3%)\n- Higher rate: 15%\n- These rates also apply to taxable income earned in the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore area\n\n**Implementation Note:**\nIf the rate changes during the tax year, base calculations on the number of days each rate is in effect.\n\n**Capital Tax on Financial Institutions:**\n- Tax rate: 6% of taxable capital employed in the province exceeding the capital deduction\n- Capital deduction: $5 million available if total capital of corporation and related group is $10 million or less\n- File Schedule 305, Newfoundland and Labrador Capital Tax on Financial Institutions\n- Enter amount on line 518 of Schedule 5\n\n**Political Contribution Tax Credit:**\n- Annual maximum credit: $500\n- Calculation:\n  - 75% of first $100 contributed\n  - 50% of next $450 contributed\n  - 33 1/3% of next $600 contributed\n- Enter total contributions on line 891 of Schedule 5\n- Enter credit amount on line 500 of Schedule 5\n\n**Venture Capital Tax Credit:**\n- Non-refundable credit: 30% of amount invested\n- Lifetime maximum credit: $75,000\n- Carry back: 3 years;
