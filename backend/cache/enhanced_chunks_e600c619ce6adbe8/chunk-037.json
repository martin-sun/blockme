When a taxpayer has more deductions than income in a tax year, they may incur a non-capital loss that can be carried back 3 years or carried forward up to 20 years to reduce taxable income in those years.\n\n### Determination of Current Year Non-capital Loss\n\nTo determine the current-year non-capital loss, complete Part 1 as follows:\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes\n- Income from all sources minus losses from business and property\n- Plus or minus adjustments on Schedule 1\n\n#### Step 2: Deduct the Following Amounts\n- **Net capital losses deducted in the year**: Net capital losses from previous years used to reduce taxable capital gains included in income\n- **Taxable dividends deductible**: Taxable dividends received, deductible under section 112 or 113 or subsection 138(6) (for details, see Line 320 on page 72)\n- **Amount of Part VI.1 tax deductible**: Unused Part VI.1 tax deductible in the taxable income calculation\n- **Amount deductible as prospector's and grubstaker's shares**: Paragraph 110(1)(d.2) – the amount deductible is the value of any shares received from a corporation on disposition of a right or a mining property, except if the amount is exempt from tax in Canada by virtue of one of Canada's tax treaties, multiplied by 1/2\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate Subtotal\n- If the result is positive, enter \"0\"\n- If the result is negative, this amount represents your current-year non-capital loss\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Simple Non-capital Loss Calculation\n- Net income for tax purposes: $10,000\n- Net capital losses deducted: $3,000\n- Taxable dividends deductible: $2,000\n- Part VI.1 tax deductible: $500\n- Prospector's shares deductible: $0\n\nCalculation:\n$10,000 - $3,000 - $2,000 - $500 = $4,500\nSince the result is positive, the non-capital loss is $0.\n\n#### Example 2: Non-capital Loss Result\n- Net loss for tax purposes: -$5,000\n- Net capital losses deducted: $0\n- Taxable dividends deductible: $1,000\n- Part VI.1 tax deductible: $0\n- Prospector's shares deductible: $500\n\nCalculation:\n-$5,000 - $0 - $1,000 - $0 - $500 = -$6,500\nSince the result is negative, the current-year non-capital loss is $6,500.\n\n### Implementation Notes for Developers\n\nWhen building tax applications:\n\n1. **Data Structure**: Create a form that captures all required inputs for non-capital loss calculation\n2. **Validation**: Ensure all monetary inputs are properly validated\n3. **Calculation Logic**: Implement the step-by-step calculation process\n4. **Result Handling**: Display \"0\" for positive results and the absolute value for negative results\n5. **Carry-forward Tracking**: Implement functionality to track non-capital losses that can be carried forward to other years\n6. **Reference Integration**: Include links to relevant CRA documentation (e.g., T1 Guide, Schedule 1)\n\n### Related Forms and Schedules\n- T1 General Income Tax and Benefit Return\n- Schedule 1 - Federal Tax\n- T1 Guide - Completing your Income Tax and Benefit Return",
