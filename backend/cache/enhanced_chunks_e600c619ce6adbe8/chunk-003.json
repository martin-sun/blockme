It represents the corporation's profit from its operations and other sources.\n\n**Formula:** `Net Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses`\n\nThis figure is the starting point for determining the corporation's tax liability and, consequently, its eligibility for and the application of various tax credits.\n\n### Developer Action: Data Inputs for Net Income\nTo calculate net income, your application must aggregate data from various sources:\n*   **Business Income:** Revenue from primary operations.\n*   **Capital Gains:** Profits from the sale of capital property.\n*   **Investment Income:** Interest, dividends, and rental income.\n*   **Other Income:** Any other sources of revenue.\n*   **Eligible Expenses:** Business operating costs, salaries, rent, etc.\n\n### Example: A Simple Net Income Calculation\nA software development corporation reports the following for its fiscal year:\n*   Revenue from contracts: $500,000\n*   Salaries and wages: $200,000\n*   Office rent and utilities: $60,000\n*   Other operating expenses: $90,000\n\n**Calculation:**\n`$500,000 (Revenue) - ($200,000 + $60,000 + $90,000) (Expenses) = $150,000 Net Income`\n\nThis $150,000 is the starting point for the tax calculation.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding and Applying Losses\n\nWhen expenses exceed revenue, a corporation incurs a loss. These losses are valuable assets that can be used to reduce taxable income in other years, thereby lowering the tax base before credits are applied.\n\n### Types of Losses\nIt is critical to distinguish between loss types for application rules:\n*   **Non-Capital Losses:** Arise from business or property operations. These are the most common and flexible.\n*   **Net Capital Losses:** Arise when capital losses exceed capital gains. Their application is more restricted.\n\n### The Power of Carrybacks and Carryforwards\nCorporations can apply losses to other taxation years to reduce tax payable.\n*   **Carryback:** Apply a loss to a preceding year to recover taxes previously paid.\n*   **Carryforward:** Apply a loss to a future year to reduce future tax liability.\n\n**Rule for Non-Capital Losses:** Can be carried back **3 years** and carried forward **20 years**.\n\n### Developer Action: Tracking Loss Attributes\nYour application must maintain a detailed ledger for each loss incurred. Key data points to track include:\n*   `lossType`: (e.g., 'non-capital', 'net-capital')\n*   `yearIncurred`: The taxation year the loss originated.\n*   `originalAmount`: The total loss amount for that year.\n*   `remainingCarryforwardAmount`: The balance available for future use, updated annually.\n*   `expiryYear`: The final year the loss can be applied (20 years after the year incurred for non-capital losses).\n\n### Example: Applying a Non-Capital Loss Carryforward\n*   **Year 1:** The corporation incurs a non-capital loss of **$80,000**.\n*   **Year 2:** The corporation calculates a net income of **$150,000**.\n\nBefore calculating tax for Year 2, the corporation can apply the Year 1 loss:\n`$150,000 (Year 2 Net Income) - $80,000 (Year 1 Loss Carryforward) = $70,000 Adjusted Income`\n\nThis $70,000 is the new base for further adjustments to arrive at taxable income.\n\n---\n\n## From Net Income to Taxable Income\n\nTaxable income is the figure upon which Part I federal and provincial/territorial tax is calculated. It is derived from net income after applying specific deductions outlined in the Income Tax Act.\n\n### Key Adjustments\nCommon adjustments that reduce net income to arrive at taxable income include:\n*   **Capital Cost Allowance (CCA):** The tax-deductible depreciation of assets.\n*   **Dividend Deduction:** A deduction for dividends received from other taxable Canadian corporations.\n*   **Applied Losses:** Non-capital and net capital losses applied from other years.\n\n### The Critical Formula\n`Taxable Income = Net Income for Tax Purposes - Deductions (including applied losses)`\n\n### Example: Calculating Final Taxable Income\nContinuing from the previous example:\n*   Adjusted Income after applying loss: **$70,000**\n*   Let's assume the corporation claims **$15,000** in CCA for Year 2.\n\n**Calculation:**\n`$70,000 (Adjusted Income) - $15,000 (CCA Deduction) = $55,000 Taxable Income`\n\n---\n\n## The Link to Tax Credits\n\nUnderstanding the flow from net income to taxable income is crucial because **tax credits are applied *after* tax is calculated on taxable income**. They reduce the final tax payable, not the taxable income itself.\n\n### The Order of Operations\nFor developers, this sequence is paramount:\n1.  Calculate **Net Income**.\n2.  Apply deductions (losses, CCA, etc.) to determine **Taxable Income**.\n3.  Calculate the **Part I Tax Payable** based on the Taxable Income.\n4.  **Apply Tax Credits** (federal, provincial, refundable, non-refundable) to reduce the tax payable from step 3.\n\n### Developer Implication\nA credit cannot create a negative taxable income. It can only reduce the tax calculated on that income to zero (for non-refundable credits) or below (for refundable credits). Your application logic must enforce this separation.\n\n*   **Non-Refundable Credits:** Can reduce tax payable to $0, but any excess is wasted.\n*   **Refundable Credits:** Can reduce tax payable below $0, resulting in a refund.\n\n### Example: Applying a Credit\n*   **Taxable Income:** **$55,000**\n*   **Federal Tax Rate (simplified):** 15%\n*   **Calculated Federal Tax:** `$55,000 * 0.15 = $8,250`\n*   **Available Non-Refundable Credit:** A $1,000 investment tax credit.\n\n**Final Tax Payable Calculation:**\n`$8,250 (Calculated Tax) - $1,000 (Applied Credit) = $7,250 Final Federal Tax Payable`\n\n---\n\n## Relevant CRA Forms and Schedules\n\n### T2 Corporation Income Tax Return\nThe main form where the summary of these calculations is reported.\n*   **Page 3 of the T2 return:** Details the calculation of net income and taxable income.\n*   **Schedule 1:** Used to calculate taxable income.\n*   **Schedule 4:** **Corporation Loss Continuity and Application**. This schedule is critical for tracking the history and application of all losses. Your application should be designed to generate or map data directly to this schedule to ensure compliance and accurate tracking of loss carryforwards and carrybacks.",
