The calculation of the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the property is depreciable or non-depreciable.\n\n### Data Requirements for Each Disposition\n\nFor each property disposed of, the following data points are required for calculation:\n\n*   **Municipal Address**: The full address of the property.\n*   **Property Type**: Classification as either depreciable (e.g., rental building) or non-depreciable (e.g., land).\n*   **Date of Disposition**: The date the property was sold.\n*   **Proceeds of Disposition**: The gross amount received or to be received for the property.\n*   **Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)**: The original cost of the property plus capital expenditures, minus capital returns and CCA claimed (for non-depreciable property, CCA is not claimed).\n*   **Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC)**: The tax value of the depreciable property at the beginning of the tax year. This is critical for depreciable property calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation Logic and Scenarios\n\nThe tax treatment of the disposition is determined by the property type.\n\n#### ### Scenario 1: Non-Depreciable Real Property\n\nDispositions of non-depreciable property (such as vacant land or a personal-use cottage) result in a capital gain or capital loss. This rule does not apply if the property is held as inventory (e.g., by a property developer).\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   **Capital Gain**: `Proceeds of Disposition - Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)`\n    *   **Capital Loss**: `Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) - Proceeds of Disposition`\n\n*   **Example**:\n    A taxpayer sells a parcel of land (non-depreciable property).\n    *   Proceeds of Disposition: $200,000\n    *   Adjusted Cost Base (ACB): $150,000\n    *   **Result**: A capital gain of $50,000 ($200,000 - $150,000).\n\n---\n\n#### ### Scenario 2: Depreciable Real Property\n\nDispositions of depreciable property (such as a rental building) can result in three different outcomes: a capital gain, a recapture of Capital Cost Allowance (CCA), or a terminal loss. The outcome depends on the relationship between the proceeds of disposition, the original cost, and the UCC.\n\n*   **Case A: Capital Gain**\n    Occurs when the **Proceeds of Disposition** are greater than the **Original Cost** of the property.\n    *   **Calculation**: The capital gain is `Proceeds of Disposition - Original Cost`. In addition, all CCA claimed over the years (`Original Cost - UCC`) is considered recaptured and must be included as income.\n\n*   **Case B: Recapture of CCA**\n    Occurs when the **Proceeds of Disposition** are less than the **Original Cost** but greater than the **UCC**.\n    *   **Calculation**: The recapture amount is `Proceeds of Disposition - UCC`. This amount is added to business or property income for the year.\n\n*   **Case C: Terminal Loss**\n    Occurs when the **Proceeds of Disposition** are less than the **UCC**.\n    *   **Calculation**: The terminal loss is `UCC - Proceeds of Disposition`. This amount is deductible from business or property income for the year.\n\n*   **Example (Recapture)**:\n    A taxpayer sells a rental building (depreciable property).\n    *   Original Cost: $500,000\n    *   UCC at beginning of year: $400,000\n    *   Proceeds of Disposition: $450,000\n    *   **Analysis**: The proceeds ($450,000) are less than the original cost ($500,000) but greater than the UCC ($400,000).\n    *   **Result**: A recapture of CCA of $50,000 ($450,000 - $400,000). This amount is included as income.\n\n---\n\n### Final Reporting\n\nAfter calculating the gain, recapture, or terminal loss for each disposed property, sum the results.\n\n*   Enter the total net amount from all real estate dispositions at **Amount B** on the form.\n\n### Reference\n*   **IT-218, Profit, Capital Gains and Losses From the Sale of Real Estate, Including Farmland and Inherited Land and Conversion of Real Estate From Capital Property to Inventory and Vice Versa**",
