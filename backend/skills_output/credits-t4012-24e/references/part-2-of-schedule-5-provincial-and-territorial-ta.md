## Provincial and Territorial Tax Credits and Rebates

### Part 2 of Schedule 5 - Provincial and Territorial Tax Payable, Tax Credits, and Rebates

#### When to Complete Part 2 of Schedule 5

Corporations must complete Part 2 of Schedule 5 if any of the following conditions apply:

- There is provincial or territorial tax payable (and a permanent establishment in more than one province or territory)
- There is a claim for provincial or territorial tax credits or rebates
- There is a claim for provincial or territorial refundable tax credits

**Special Provincial Requirements:**

- **Quebec and Alberta**: Corporations with a permanent establishment must complete the appropriate provincial corporation returns and schedules to report provincial tax and claim provincial credits and rebates.
  
- **Ontario**: Corporations with a permanent establishment must also complete Part 2 of Schedule 5 if any of these conditions apply:
  - Claiming the Ontario small business deduction
  - Claiming the Ontario credit union reduction
  - Has an addition to Ontario basic income tax (such as a transitional tax debit)
  - Has Ontario corporate minimum tax payable
  - Has Ontario special additional tax on life insurance corporations payable

- **Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia**: Corporations must complete Part 2 if they have capital tax on financial institutions payable.

#### Reporting Provincial and Territorial Tax

On line 255 of Schedule 5, enter the net amount of provincial and territorial tax payable or the net amount of refundable credits:

- **Positive result**: Enter the net provincial or territorial tax payable on line 760 of the return
- **Negative result**: Enter the refundable provincial or territorial tax credit on line 812 of the return

Attach to your return any forms you completed to claim provincial or territorial credits or rebates.

### Provincial and Territorial Tax Rates

#### Dual Rate Structure

Provinces and territories generally have two rates of income tax:

1. **Lower Rate**: Applies to income eligible for the federal small business deduction
2. **Higher Rate**: Applies to all other income

**Business Limit Considerations:**
- Some provinces use the federal business limit
- Others establish their own business limit
- When allocating taxable income to multiple provinces, proportionally allocate income eligible for the federal small business deduction

#### Example 1: Single Province Calculation

Corp X earned all its income in 2024 from its permanent establishment in Newfoundland and Labrador. Corp X claimed the small business deduction when calculating federal tax payable.

- Income from active business carried on in Canada: $78,000
- Newfoundland and Labrador lower rate: 2.5%
- Newfoundland and Labrador higher rate: 15%

**Calculation:**
```
Taxable income: $90,000
Subtract amount taxed at lower rate: $78,000
Amount taxed at higher rate: $12,000

Taxes payable at lower rate: $78,000 × 2.5% = $1,950
Taxes payable at higher rate: $12,000 × 15% = $1,800
Newfoundland and Labrador tax payable: $3,750
```

#### Example 2: Multi-Provincial Allocation

Corp Y has permanent establishments in both Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut. Tax year: January 1 to December 31, 2024. Corp Y claimed the small business deduction when calculating federal tax payable.

- Newfoundland and Labrador lower rate: 2.5%
- Newfoundland and Labrador higher rate: 15%

**Newfoundland and Labrador Calculation:**
```
Taxable income allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador: $60,000
Taxable income allocated to Nunavut: $30,000
Total taxable income earned in Canada: $90,000
Federal small business deduction amount: $78,000

Income eligible for federal small business deduction attributed to Newfoundland and Labrador:
$60,000 × $78,000 ÷ $90,000 = $52,000

Taxable income earned in Newfoundland and Labrador: $60,000
Subtract: Income eligible for small business deduction attributed to NL: $52,000
Amount taxed at higher rate: $8,000

Taxes payable at higher rate: $8,000 × 15% = $1,200
Taxes payable at lower rate: $52,000 × 2.5% = $1,300
Newfoundland and Labrador tax payable: $2,500
```

To calculate Nunavut income tax payable, Corp Y would repeat the same steps using Nunavut's rates.

### Provincial and Territorial Foreign Tax Credits

Every province and territory allows corporations to claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to another country on foreign non-business income. This credit reduces provincial tax otherwise payable.

**Important Notes:**
- Cannot claim foreign tax credits for Quebec and Alberta on the federal return (these provinces collect their own income taxes)
- Credit is available only if foreign non-business income tax paid exceeds the federal foreign non-business income tax credit deductible for the year
- For each province/territory claiming a credit, complete a separate calculation
- For each foreign country paid to, complete a separate calculation
- When dual rates apply, use the higher rate when calculating the foreign tax credit (for Ontario, use the basic rate)

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- Resident in Canada throughout the tax year
- Has a permanent establishment in the province or territory at any time during the tax year
- Has foreign investment income for the tax year

**Special Ontario Rule:**
An authorized foreign bank is eligible for the foreign tax credit if it performed Canadian banking business.

**Implementation Note:**
If the tax rate changed during the tax year, prorate the calculation in Part 9 of Schedule 21 using the number of days in each period. For British Columbia, prorate the tax rate in each period, round to the nearest one-thousandth of one percent (0.001%), and add the rounded percentages before multiplying by foreign non-business income.

To claim the foreign tax credit, complete Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit.
