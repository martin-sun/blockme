## Chapter 3 – Page 3 of the T2 Return

### Line 320 – Taxable dividends received

The following types of taxable dividends received are not deductible under section 112:
- Dividends from a corporation that is exempt from Part I tax
- Dividends on collateralized preferred shares (loss rental plans)
- Dividends that are part of a dividend rental arrangement, as defined in subsection 248(1)
- Dividends on term preferred shares received by certain financial institutions
- Dividends on shares guaranteed by a specified financial institution, as described in subsection 112(2.2)

**References:**
- Subsections 112(1), 112(2), and 112(2.1) to 112(2.9)
- Section 113 contains the authority and limitations concerning the deduction of dividends received from foreign affiliates
- Subsection 138(6) contains the authority for a life insurer to deduct taxable dividends received from taxable Canadian corporations

On line 320, enter the amount of taxable dividends (as per Schedule 3) deductible in calculating taxable income under section 112, 113, or subsection 138(6). This amount is the total of column 240 of Schedule 3.

**Note:** A dividend does not include stock dividends received from a non-resident corporation.

By deducting taxable dividends received from net income or loss amount shown on line 300, you can create or increase a non-capital loss for the year.

**Reference:** IT-269, Part IV Tax on Taxable Dividends Received by a Private Corporation or a Subject Corporation

### Line 325 – Part VI.1 tax deduction

A corporation that pays Part VI.1 tax on dividends it paid on taxable preferred shares and short-term preferred shares can deduct 3.5 times the Part VI.1 tax the corporation has to pay. For details on how to calculate Part VI.1 tax, see "Line 724 – Part VI.1 tax payable" on page 97.

On line 325, enter the Part VI.1 tax times 3.5.

**Reference:** Paragraph 110(1)(k)

### Line 331 – Non-capital losses of previous tax years

On line 331, enter any non-capital losses carried forward from previous years to reduce taxable income from line 130 of Schedule 4.

On line 330 of Schedule 3, enter the amount of current-year non-capital losses, and on line 335, enter the non-capital losses from previous years to be used to reduce dividends subject to Part IV tax.

The total of those two amounts must be entered as an applied amount on line 135 of Schedule 4. For details, see "How to complete Schedule 4, Part 1 – Non-capital losses" on page 67.

**References:**
- Paragraphs 111(1)(a), 186(1)(c), and 186(1)(d)

### Line 332 – Net-capital losses of previous tax years

On line 332, enter the amount of net capital losses from previous years that you applied against taxable capital gain incurred in the year. This amount is the capital loss entered on line 225 of Schedule 4 that you multiply by 50%. See "How to complete Schedule 4, Part 2 – Capital losses" on page 67 for details.

**Note:** A net capital loss can create a non-capital loss in the year you apply it, because the net capital loss is not limited to reducing the taxable income, but to reducing the taxable capital gain in that year.

**References:**
- Section 38
- Subsections 111(1.1) and 111(8)
- Paragraph 111(1)(b)

### Line 333 – Restricted farm losses of previous tax years

On line 333, enter the amount you want to apply to reduce the current-year farm income. On line 430 of Schedule 4, enter the amount of restricted farm loss used. For details, see page 68.

**Reference:** Paragraph 111(1)(c)

### Line 334 – Farm losses of previous tax years

On line 334, enter the farm losses you are carrying forward from previous years to reduce taxable income from line 330 of Schedule 4.

On line 340 of Schedule 3, enter the amount of the current-year farm loss, and on line 345, enter the previous years' farm losses that you are using to reduce dividends subject to Part IV tax.

The total of those two amounts must be entered on line 335 of Schedule 4 as the amount applied. For details, see "How to complete Schedule 4, Part 3 – Farm losses" on page 68.

**References:**
- Paragraphs 111(1)(d), 186(1)(c), and 186(1)(d)

### Line 335 – Limited partnership losses of previous tax years

On line 335, enter the deductible amount of limited partnership losses from previous years that were applied against other incomes in the current year from Part 7 of Schedule 4. See page 69 for more details.

**Reference:** Paragraph 111(1)(e)

### Line 340 – Taxable capital gains or taxable dividends allocated from a central credit union

If a central credit union has made an election under subsection 137(5.1), amounts allocated to a member credit union as taxable dividends or net non-taxable capital gains may be claimed by that member as a deduction from taxable income under paragraph 137(5.2)(c). Enter these amounts on line 340.

### Line 350 – Prospector's and grubstaker's shares

You can deduct 1/2 of the value of any shares received from a corporation in exchange for the disposition of an interest in a mining property, except if the amount is exempt under a tax treaty. Upon the disposition or exchange of those shares, you can deduct 1/2 of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at the time of disposition of the mining property or at the time of the disposition or exchange of the shares.

**Reference:** Paragraph 110(1)(d.2)

### Line 352 – Employer deduction for non-qualified securities

Canada's tax treatment of employee stock options granted after June 30, 2021, applies a $200,000 annual limit (on a calendar year basis) on employee stock option grants that can receive preferred tax treatment.

Generally, employee stock option benefits remain uncapped for:
- Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs)
- Non-CCPCs employers with annual gross revenue of $500 million or less (taking into account the gross revenue of a corporate group that prepared a consolidated financial statement, when the employer is member of such a group)

If a security is deemed to be a non-qualified security for the 50% stock option deduction (either in the case of designation by the employer or because it was more than the annual vesting limit), the employer can claim a deduction equal to the benefit received by an employee where the security would otherwise be deductible under paragraph 110(1)(d).

The employer must notify:
- The employee, in writing, that the security is a non-qualified security no later than 30 days after the day that the agreement is entered into
- The Canada Revenue Agency that the security is a non-qualified security by filing Schedule 59, Information Return for Non-Qualified Securities, with its T2 return for the tax year that includes the day on which the agreement is entered into

For more information on your obligations regarding the payroll reporting of the taxable benefit from the non-qualified securities, see canada.ca/taxes-security-options.

### Line 355 – Section 110.5 additions or subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) additions

You can use foreign tax deductions to reduce Part I tax that you would otherwise have to pay. Under section 110.5 and subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii), a corporation that cannot deduct its foreign income tax deductions (for example, if it has no Part I tax payable for the year) can choose to add an amount to its taxable income. In this way, the corporation can use these otherwise non-deductible foreign tax deductions.

The amount you add to income for this purpose forms part of the non-capital loss. See page 67 for details.

However, you cannot add an amount under section 110.5 if that addition increases any of the following deductible amounts:
- The small business deduction
- The manufacturing and processing profits deduction
- The federal logging tax credit
- The investment tax credit (ITC)
- The share-purchase tax credit
- The SR&ED investment tax credit

If the corporation is an authorized foreign bank, you cannot add an amount under subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) if that addition increases any of the following deductible amounts:
- The federal logging tax credit
- The ITC

On line 355, enter the amount you added to income under section 110.5 or subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii).

### Line 360 – Taxable income

To calculate this amount, subtract all the deductions you entered on lines 311 to 352 from the net income for income tax purposes on line 300. Add, if it applies, section 110.5 or subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) additions (line 355). Enter the taxable income on line 360.

If the result is a loss, enter "0" on line 360.

**Note:** If you want to carry back a current-year loss to a previous tax year, see "How to complete Schedule 4" on page 67 for details.

## Chapter 4 – Page 4 of the T2 Return

### Small business deduction

Corporations that were Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) throughout the tax year may be able to claim the small business deduction (SBD). The SBD reduces Part I tax that the corporation would otherwise have to pay.

The SBD is 19% of whichever of the following amounts is less:
- The income from active business carried on in Canada (line 400)
- The taxable income (line 405)
- The business limit (line 410)
- The amount on line 428, which is the reduced business limit on line 426 from which you deduct the amount of the business limit you assigned under subsection 125(3.2)

The basic rate of Part I tax being 38% of your taxable income, 28% after the federal tax abatement, the SBD rate results in a 9% tax rate.

Once you have calculated the SBD, enter it on line 430.

### Avoidance of the business limit and taxable capital limit

Where two corporations (Corps A and B) are deemed to be associated because they are associated with the same third corporation (Corp C), but because the third corporation, a CCPC, has filed a Schedule 28 election (see page 34), they are deemed not to be associated with each other for determining the SBD, the following applies:
- Investment income derived from Corp C that is deemed by subsection 129(6) to be active business income is not eligible for the SBD and is taxed at the general corporation income tax rate
- Corps A and B remain associated with Corp C. They must include the taxable capital limit of Corp C when calculating the SBD

### Preventing multiplication of the small business deduction

To address concerns about partnership structures that multiply access to the SBD, the specified partnership income rules also apply, for example, to partnership structures in which a CCPC provides services or property to a partnership during the tax year of the CCPC, where the CCPC or a shareholder of the CCPC is a member of the partnership. A similar measure also applies for corporate structures that multiply access to the SBD.

### Line 400 – Income from active business carried on in Canada

Complete Schedule 7, Aggregate Investment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business Deduction, to determine the following amounts:
- The aggregate investment income and foreign investment income for determining the refundable portion of Part I tax (see "Refundable portion of Part I tax, Lines 440, 445, and 450" on page 80 for details)
- The specified partnership income for members (or designated members) of a partnership
- The income from an active business carried on in Canada for the SBD

CCPCs may now assign all or part of their business limit under subsection 125(3.2) or specified partnership business limit under subsection 125(8) to another corporation.

Use Schedule 7 to assign all or part of your specified partnership business limit to another corporation.

Also file Schedule 7 if another corporation assigned all or part of its business limit to your CCPC or if a member of a partnership assigned all or part of the member's specified partnership business limit to your CCPC.

If you are assigning all or part of your business limit to another corporation, report it on page 4 of the T2 return.

**Note:** If claiming a deduction for patronage dividends on line 416 of Schedule 1, complete Part 5 of Schedule 16 to establish active business income carried on in Canada (see page 65 for details).

### Active business income

Generally, active business income is income earned from a business source, including any income incidental to the business.

Income from a specified investment business or from a personal services business, and income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of specified corporate income in subsection 125(7) for the year are generally not considered active business income and are not eligible for the SBD. The following three sections explain when income from these types of businesses may be considered active business income and eligible for the SBD.

### Specified investment business

A specified investment business is a business with the principal purpose of deriving income from property, including interest, dividends, rents, or royalties. It also includes a business carried on by a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital corporation, the principal purpose of which is to derive income from property.

Except for a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital corporation, income from a specified investment business is considered to be active business income, and is therefore eligible for the SBD if:
- The corporation employs more than five full-time employees in the business throughout the year, or
- An associated corporation provides managerial, financial, administrative, maintenance, or other similar services to the corporation while carrying on an active business, and the corporation would have to engage more than five full-time employees to perform these services if the associated corporation were not providing them

**Note:** The business a credit union carries on, or the business of leasing property other than real property, is not considered specified investment business.

### Personal services business

A personal services business is a business that a corporation carries on to provide services to another entity (such as a person or a partnership) that an officer or employee of that entity would usually perform. Instead, an individual performs the services on behalf of the corporation. That individual is called an incorporated employee.

Any income the corporation derives from providing the services is considered income from a personal services business, as long as both of the following conditions are met:
- The incorporated employee who is performing the services, or any person related to him or her, is a specified shareholder of the corporation
- The incorporated employee would, if it were not for the existence of the corporation, reasonably be considered an officer or employee of the entity receiving the services

However, if the corporation employs more than five full-time employees throughout the year or provides the services to an associated corporation, the income is not considered to be from a personal services business. Therefore, the income is eligible for the SBD.

Deductions in computing income for a personal services business are restricted to the following:
- Salary, wages, or other remuneration of the incorporated employee
- Cost of other benefits or allowances provided to the incorporated employee
- Certain expenses of the corporation associated with selling property or negotiating contracts
- Legal expenses paid in the year by the corporation in collecting amounts owed for services rendered

**Note:** Any expenses denied must be added back on Schedule 1.

For more information on the factors to take into account when a person is considered an employee, see Guide RC4110, Employee or self-employed? or go to canada.ca/cpp-ei-rulings.

**Reference:** Paragraph 18(1)(p)

### Specified corporate income

Generally, where a CCPC earns income that would otherwise be considered as income from an active business from providing property or services to another private corporation and it (or one of its shareholders) or a person who does not deal at arm's length with the CCPC (or one of its shareholders) holds a direct or indirect interest in that other private corporation, the income would not be considered as being eligible for the SBD unless certain conditions are met.

For more information, see the definition of specified corporate income in subsection 125(7).

### Specified farming or fishing income

The definition of specified farming or fishing income replaced the definition of specified cooperative income, which has been retroactively repealed. The definition of specified corporate income excludes specified farming or fishing income, so that such income stays eligible for the SBD by default.

Specified farming or fishing income, of a corporation for a tax year, means income of the corporation (other than an amount included in its income under subsection 135(7), patronage dividends), if both of the following conditions are met:
- The income is from the sale of the farming products or fishing catches of the corporation's farming or fishing business to another corporation
- The corporation deals at arm's length with the other corporation

This approach eliminates the requirement that sales have to be to a farming or fishing cooperative corporation in order to be excluded from specified corporate income.

**Note:** You have to request a reassessment if, in a previous year that started after March 21, 2016, you had income that meets the definition of specified farming or fishing income, but did not meet the definition of specified cooperative income. The CRA can reassess beyond the normal reassessment period for this specific purpose. You will find information on how to request a reassessment on page 21.

### Specified shareholder

A specified shareholder is a taxpayer who owns, directly or indirectly at any time in the year, at least 10% of the issued shares of any class of capital stock of the corporation or a related corporation.

### How to calculate income from an active business carried on in Canada

Generally, to calculate active business income from carrying on a business in Canada, you have to deduct from net income for income tax purposes any of the following amounts that apply:
- Taxable capital gains minus allowable capital losses
- Dividends that are deductible from income under sections 112 and 113, and subsection 138(6)
- Property income minus property losses
- Property income from an interest in a trust
- Foreign business income
- Income from a specified investment business
- Income from a personal services business
- Income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of specified corporate income in subsection 125(7) for the year where certain conditions are not met

### Specified partnership income

A corporation that is a member (or a designated member) of a partnership has to complete Schedule 7 to calculate its active business income.

The specified partnership income rules impose a limit on the amount of active business income earned by a corporation as a member or designated member of a partnership that is eligible for the SBD. The eligible amount is referred to as specified partnership income and is added to the corporation's active business income from other sources, if any.

For members of a partnership, their specified partnership business limit is normally their pro-rata share of a notional $500,000 business limit for the partnership.

For designated members of a partnership, their specified partnership business limit is nil, unless they get an amount assigned from a member of the partnership.

If the partnership incurs a loss from carrying on an active business, you have to deduct the corporation's share of that loss from its active business income. This is referred to as a specified partnership loss.

If your corporation is a member of a partnership in respect of which it filed a Schedule 73, you have to add or deduct the total active business income determined under section 34.2.

If the corporation received an information slip T5013, Statement of Partnership Income, that shows its share of partnership income or loss, keep it in case the CRA asks for it later. Do not include this form with the return. For more information, see page 35 and Guide T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return (T5013 Forms).

On line 400, enter the total active business income you calculated on Schedule 7.

- Section 251
- IT-73, The Small Business Deduction

### Line 405 – Taxable income for the SBD

The taxable income you use to calculate the SBD is usually the amount entered on line 360. However, if you have claimed a foreign non-business income tax credit, a foreign business income tax credit, or both, you have to reduce the taxable income by both of the following:
- 100/28 of the amount that would be deductible as a federal foreign non-business income tax credit on line 632, if that credit was determined without the refundable tax on the CCPC's investment income (line 604) and without reference to the corporate tax reduction under section 123.4
- Four times the amount that would be deductible as a federal foreign business income tax credit (line 636) if that credit was determined without reference to the corporate tax reduction under section 123.4. See page 79

You also have to reduce taxable income by any amount that, because of federal law, is exempt from Part I tax.

On line 405, enter your taxable income for the purposes of calculating the SBD.

**References:**
- Paragraph 125(1)(b)
- Subsection 126(7)

### Line 410 – Business limit

The maximum allowable business limit for a corporation that is not associated with any other corporation is $500,000.

CCPCs that are associated with one or more corporations during the tax year have to file Schedule 23, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Business Limit. On this schedule, a percentage of the business limit is allocated to each corporation, and the total of all percentages cannot be more than 100%. See page 33 for details about Schedule 23.

On line 410, enter the business limit for the year. If applicable, enter the amount from Schedule 23.

**Notes:**
- If the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, you have to prorate the business limit, based on the number of days in the tax year divided by 365, before you enter it on line 410.
- If a CCPC is associated with two other corporations and elects for the two other corporations not to be associated with each other for the purpose of the line 616 deduction, it has to file Schedule 28, Election not to be Associated Through a Third Corporation. For more details, see page 34.

**References:**
- Subsections 125(2), 125(3), 125(5), and 256(2)
- IT-64, Corporations: Association and Control

### Line 426 – Reduced business limit

The reduction in a CCPC's business limit is the greater of its taxable capital business limit reduction and its passive income business limit reduction for the year.

#### Taxable capital business limit reduction

Large CCPCs that have taxable capital employed in Canada of $50 million or more do not qualify for the SBD. The business limit is reduced on a straight-line basis for CCPCs that have taxable capital employed in Canada of between $10 million and $50 million in the previous year. For tax years starting before April 7, 2022, the range is $10 million to $15 million.

Similar restrictions apply to any CCPC that is a member of an associated group that has, in total, more than $10 million of taxable capital employed in Canada.

To calculate the total taxable capital employed in Canada, use the schedule that applies:
- Schedule 33, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large Corporations
- Schedule 34, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Financial Institutions
- Schedule 35, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large Insurance Corporations

If your taxable capital employed in Canada is more than $10 million, file the appropriate schedule with your return.

#### Passive income business limit reduction

The business limit of a CCPC is also reduced if the CCPC, and any other corporation it is associated with, earn combined income from $50,000 to $150,000 from passive investments. The business limit is nil once the combined income from passive investments is more than $150,000.

This income is calculated in Part 2 of Schedule 7, Aggregate Investment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business Deduction, and is referred to as the adjusted aggregate investment income.

Enter the greater amount of the reduction on line 422 and the resulting reduced business limit on line 426.

Use Schedule 23, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Business Limit, if you are an associated CCPC. For more information about this schedule, see page 33.

**Reference:** Subsections 125(5.1) and 125(7)

### Assignment of the business limit under subsection 125(3.2)

CCPCs can assign all or part of their business limit under subsection 125(3.2) to another corporation.

Enter the amount of the business limit you assign and the business number of the corporation to which you assign such an amount on page 4 of the T2 return. Deduct from line 426 the amount you assign and enter the result on line 428.

If another corporation assigned all or part of its business limit to your CCPC, file Schedule 7.

**References:** Subsections 125(3.1), (3.2), and (7)

### Line 430 – Small business deduction

Multiply the least of lines 400, 405, 410, and 428 by 19%. Enter the result on line 430 and at amount L on page 8 of the return.

## Chapter 5 – Page 5 of the T2 Return

### General tax reduction

A general tax reduction of 13% is available on qualifying income.

Corporations benefit from the general tax reduction only on taxable income that is subject to a rate of 38%.

The reduction does not apply to income that benefits from preferential corporate tax treatment, such as:
- Income eligible for the small business deduction and Canadian manufacturing and processing profits
- Income eligible for the deduction for the generation of electrical energy for sale or the production of steam for sale
- Investment income subject to the refundable tax provisions

The reduction also does not apply to income earned from a personal services business or to a corporation that was, throughout the year, an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation, or a mutual fund corporation.

**Reference:** Subsection 123.4(1)

### General tax reduction for Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs)

If you are a CCPC throughout the tax year, complete this area of page 5 to calculate the reduction. Enter the resulting amount on line 638 on page 8.

**Note:** If you are a corporation that is, throughout the year, a cooperative corporation (within the meaning assigned by subsection 136(2)) or a credit union, enter zero at amount F.

**Reference:** Subsection 123.4(2)

### General tax reduction

Do not complete this area if you are a CCPC, an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation, a mutual fund corporation, or a corporation that has income not subject to the corporation tax rate of 38%.

All other corporations complete this area of page 5 to calculate the reduction. Enter the general tax reduction on line 639 on page 8.

**Reference:** Subsection 123.4(2)
