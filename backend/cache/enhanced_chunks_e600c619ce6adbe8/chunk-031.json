These dividends are considered capital gains under the following sections of the Income Tax Act:\n- Paragraphs 130.1(4)(a) and (b)\n- Paragraphs 131(1)(a) and (b)\n\n**Applicable Entities:**\nThese provisions specifically apply to:\n- Mortgage Investment Corporations (MICs)\n- Mutual Fund Corporations\n\n**Reporting Requirements:**\nIf you received any capital gains dividends during the tax year, report the total amount on line 875.\n\n**Practical Example:**\nIf you received $500 in capital gains dividends from a mutual fund corporation and $300 from a mortgage investment corporation, you would report a total of $800 on line 875.\n\n**Implementation Notes for Developers:**\n- Validate that the entity type is either a MIC or Mutual Fund Corporation before classifying dividends as capital gains dividends\n- Ensure the system can track and sum capital gains dividends from multiple sources\n- Provide clear labeling on tax forms to distinguish capital gains dividends from other types of dividends\n\n### Line 880 – Capital Gains Reserve Balance\n\n**Definition:**\nThis line represents the opening balance of the capital gains reserve as calculated on Schedule 13 of the tax return.\n\n**Inclusion Requirements:**\nThe amount reported should include:\n- The capital gains reserve balance at the beginning of the tax year\n- Any amounts from the last tax year of predecessor corporations after amalgamation or wind-up\n\n**Practical Example:**\nIf your corporation had a capital gains reserve of $10,000 at the end of the previous tax year, and it acquired another corporation through amalgamation that had a capital gains reserve of $5,000, you would report $15,000 on line 880.\n\n**Implementation Notes for Developers:**\n- Create a data field to track the opening balance of the capital gains reserve\n- Implement logic to include reserves from predecessor corporations after corporate restructuring\n- Ensure the system maintains historical data for accurate carry-forward calculations\n- Provide validation to prevent negative values unless specifically allowed by tax regulations",
