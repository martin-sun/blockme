## Part VI.1 Tax Payable

### Calculation of Part VI.1 Tax

Part VI.1 tax is levied on dividends paid on:
- Short-term preferred shares
- Taxable preferred shares (excluding certain excluded dividends)

#### Tax Rates
- **Short-term preferred shares**: 40% tax on dividends exceeding the annual dividend allowance
- **Taxable preferred shares**: 25% or 40% tax on dividends exceeding any remaining dividend allowance
  - Choosing the 40% rate exempts the share holder from the 10% tax under Part IV.1
  - This rate applies to all future dividends on that class or series of shares

#### Example
If a corporation paid $100,000 in dividends on short-term preferred shares and has an annual dividend allowance of $20,000:
- Taxable amount: $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000
- Part VI.1 tax payable: $80,000 × 40% = $32,000

### Schedule 43 - Calculation of Part VI.1 Tax Payable
Complete Part 3 of Schedule 43 to calculate Part VI.1 tax.

### Schedule 45 - Agreement Respecting Liability for Part VI.1 Tax
A corporation (transferor) can transfer all or part of its Part VI.1 tax liability to another corporation (transferee) if:
- The corporations were related throughout the transferor's tax year for which it owes Part VI.1 tax
- The corporations were related throughout the transferee's tax year that ends on or before the end of the transferor's tax year

### Deduction of Part VI.1 Tax
- Part VI.1 tax payable can be deducted from income
- Any remaining Part VI.1 tax after reducing taxable income to zero becomes part of the non-capital loss for the year
