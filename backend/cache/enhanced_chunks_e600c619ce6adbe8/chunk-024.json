The shares had an adjusted cost base of $10,000. The capital gain is $5,000, with $2,500 (50%) being taxable.\n\n**Developer Implementation:**\n```javascript\nfunction calculateCapitalGain(proceeds, acb) {\n  const gain = proceeds - acb;\n  return {\n    totalGain: gain,\n    taxableGain: gain > 0 ? gain * 0.5 : 0,\n    allowableLoss: gain < 0 ? Math.abs(gain) * 0.5 : 0\n  };\n}\n```\n\n#### Business Income/Losses Exception\nIf the disposing corporation is in the business of trading shares, the disposition results in:\n- Business income (for gains)\n- Business loss (for losses)\n\n**Example:** Trading Corp., which buys and sells securities as its primary business, sells shares resulting in a $10,000 gain. The full $10,000 is reported as business income, not as a capital gain.\n\n**Developer Implementation:**\n```javascript\nfunction determineShareDispositionType(isTraderBusiness) {\n  return isTraderBusiness ? 'business' : 'capital';\n}\n```\n\n### Special Situations\n\n#### Corporate Reorganizations\nWhen shares are converted due to:\n- Merger\n- Amalgamation\n\nSubsection 248(1) deems a disposition to have occurred for tax purposes.\n\n**Example:** Company A merges with Company B, and shareholders of Company A receive shares of the new merged entity. For tax purposes, shareholders are deemed to have disposed of their Company A shares and acquired the new shares, potentially triggering capital gains or losses.\n\n**Developer Implementation:**\n```javascript\nfunction isDeemedDisposition(reorganizationType) {\n  return reorganizationType === 'merger' || reorganizationType === 'amalgamation';\n}\n```\n\n#### Stop-Loss Rules\nUnder paragraph 112(3)(b), corporations must reduce losses from share dispositions when:\n- The shares were held as capital property\n- Certain dividends were received on those shares\n\nThis reduction prevents taxpayers from claiming both:\n1. A capital loss on share disposition\n2. A dividend deduction on the same shares\n\n**Example:** Corp. X owns shares of Corp. Y and receives $5,000 in dividends. Later, Corp. X sells the shares at a $10,000 capital loss. Under the stop-loss rules, Corp. X must reduce its capital loss claim by the amount of dividends received, resulting in an allowable capital loss of only $5,000.\n\n**Developer Implementation:**\n```javascript\nfunction applyStopLossRules(capitalLoss, dividendsReceived, ownershipPercentage, holdingPeriod) {\n  // Check if stop-loss rules apply\n  if (ownershipPercentage >= 0.05 || holdingPeriod <= 365) {\n    const reducedLoss = Math.max(0, capitalLoss - dividendsReceived);\n    return {\n      originalLoss: capitalLoss,\n      reducedLoss: reducedLoss,\n      reductionAmount: capitalLoss - reducedLoss\n    };\n  }\n  return {\n    originalLoss: capitalLoss,\n    reducedLoss: capitalLoss,\n    reductionAmount: 0\n  };\n}\n```\n\n#### Exception to Stop-Loss Rules\nThe stop-loss rule generally does not apply when:\n- The shareholder owns less than 5% of the shares\n- The shares have been held for more than one year\n\n**Example:** Individual investor owns 2% of Corp. Z's shares (held for 3 years) and receives dividends. When selling the shares at a loss, the stop-loss rules do not apply, and the full capital loss can be claimed.\n\n### Reporting Instructions\n1. Enter the total adjustment for losses identified in Part 1 on line 160\n2. Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on disposition of shares at amount A\n\n**Developer Implementation:**\n```javascript\nfunction calculateReportingValues(sharesDisposed) {\n  let totalGainLoss = 0;\n  let totalAdjustment = 0;\n  \n  sharesDisposed.forEach(share => {\n    const gainLoss = calculateCapitalGain(share.proceeds_of_disposition, share.adjusted_cost_base);\n    totalGainLoss += gainLoss.totalGain;\n    \n    if (gainLoss.totalGain < 0) {\n      const stopLossResult = applyStopLossRules(\n        Math.abs(gainLoss.totalGain),\n        share.dividends_received || 0,\n        share.ownership_percentage || 0,\n        calculateHoldingPeriod(share.acquisition_date, share.disposition_date)\n      );\n      totalAdjustment += stopLossResult.reductionAmount;\n    }\n  });\n  \n  return {\n    amountA: totalGainLoss,\n    line160Adjustment: totalAdjustment\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Reference\nIT-328, Losses on Shares on Which Dividends Have Been Received",
