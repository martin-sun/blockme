They can use Schedule 45 to allocate this tax as follows:\n- Corporation A: $7,500\n- Corporation B: $5,000\n- Corporation C: $2,500\n\n**For developers:**\n- Create forms for allocating Part VI.1 tax among related corporations\n- Include validation to ensure total allocation equals the total Part VI.1 tax\n- Implement logic for tracking related corporation information\n\n### Other Tax Payable Categories\n\n#### Line 725 – Part VI.2 Tax Payable\n\nPart VI.2 tax applies to certain financial institutions and relates to their capital tax obligations.

The Part XIII.1 tax rate is 25%, resulting in $2,500 tax payable.\n\n**For developers:**\n- Implement calculation logic for various types of passive income paid to non-residents\n- Include different tax rates based on tax treaty provisions\n- Create fields for treaty-based reductions\n\n#### Line 728 – Part XIV Tax Payable\n\nPart XIV tax relates to the tax on large corporations. It applies to corporations with taxable capital employed in Canada exceeding $50 million.\n\n**For developers:**\n- Implement threshold checks for taxable capital\n- Include progressive tax rate calculations based on capital amounts\n- Create fields for capital employed in Canada calculations\n\n### Provincial and Territorial Tax\n\n#### Permanent Establishment\n\nA permanent establishment is a fixed place of business in a province or territory, which determines where provincial/territorial tax is payable. This includes:\n- Offices\n- Factories\n- Warehouses\n- Construction sites lasting more than 12 months\n\n**For developers:**\n- Create logic to identify permanent establishments in each jurisdiction\n- Implement allocation formulas for income attributable to each permanent establishment\n- Include fields for physical presence details\n\n#### Line 750 – Provincial or Territorial Jurisdiction\n\nThis line identifies which provincial or territorial tax forms need to be completed based on where the corporation has permanent establishments.\n\n**Example:**\nA corporation with permanent establishments in Ontario and Alberta would need to complete:\n- T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (Federal)\n- ON428 Corporation Tax Schedule (Ontario)\n- AT1 Return of Income (Alberta)\n\n**For developers:**\n- Implement jurisdiction selection based on permanent establishment locations\n- Create conditional form requirements based on selected jurisdictions\n- Include mapping to appropriate provincial/territorial forms\n\n#### Line 760 – Net Provincial and Territorial Tax Payable\n\nThis line calculates the total provincial and territorial tax payable after accounting for:\n- Provincial/territorial tax credits\n- Abatements\n- Other reductions\n\n**For developers:**\n- Implement calculation logic for each provincial/territorial tax system\n- Include fields for various provincial credits and deductions\n- Create summation logic for multiple jurisdictions\n\n### Schedule 5 – Tax Calculation Supplementary – Corporations\n\nSchedule 5 provides additional calculations for corporate tax, including:\n- Tax reductions for small businesses\n- Manufacturing and processing profits deductions\n- General tax reductions\n- Investment tax credits\n\n**For developers:**\n- Implement comprehensive calculation fields for various tax reductions\n- Include logic for small business deduction eligibility\n- Create fields for investment tax credit calculations\n- Implement validation for reduction limits and interactions",
