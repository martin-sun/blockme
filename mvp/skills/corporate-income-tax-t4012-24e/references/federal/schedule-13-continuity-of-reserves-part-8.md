### Refundable Portion of Part I Tax
**Lines 440, 445, and 450**

The refundable portion of Part I tax is part of the non-eligible refundable dividend tax on hand (NERDTOH). More information about NERDTOH is in the section that follows.

The refundable portion of Part I tax allows a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) that has paid Part I tax on investment income to recover part of that tax when the corporation pays taxable dividends to its shareholders. The refundable portion of Part I tax only applies to corporations that are CCPCs throughout the tax year.

The refundable portion of Part I tax is based on the aggregate investment income and foreign investment income. You have to determine these amounts by completing Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 7, Aggregate Investment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business Deduction.

#### Part 1 – Aggregate Investment Income Calculation
The aggregate investment income is the aggregate world source income calculated as follows:

**Add:**
- The eligible portion of the taxable capital gains for the year that is more than the total of:
  - The eligible portion of allowable capital losses for the year
  - The net capital losses from previous years which are applied in the year
- Total income from property (including income from a specified investment business carried on in Canada other than income from a source outside Canada) from which the following amounts have been deducted:
  - Exempt income
  - AgriInvest receipts (include the Quebec amount)
  - Taxable dividends deductible after deducting related expenses
  - Business income from an interest in a trust that is considered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a)

**Deduct:**
- Total losses for the year from property (including losses from a specified investment business carried on in Canada other than losses from a source outside Canada)

On line 440 enter the amount of aggregate investment income that you determined on line 092 of Schedule 7.

You can include taxable capital gains and allowable capital losses in a CCPC's net investment income only if you can attribute the gain or loss to a period of time when a CCPC, an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation, or a mutual fund corporation held the disposed property.

**Note:** Part 2, Adjusted Aggregate Investment Income, of Schedule 7, is used to calculate the small business deduction for tax years starting after 2018 on page 4 of the return.

#### Part 3 – Foreign Investment Income Calculation
The foreign investment income is all income from only sources outside of Canada calculated as follows:

**Add:**
- The eligible portion of the taxable capital gains for the year that is more than the eligible portion of allowable capital losses for the year
- The total income from property from a source outside Canada from which the following amounts have been deducted:
  - Exempt income
  - Taxable dividends deductible after deducting related expenses
  - Business income from an interest in a trust that is considered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a)

**Deduct:**
- The total losses for the year from property from a source outside Canada

On line 445 enter the amount of foreign investment income that you determined on line 079 of Schedule 7.

Calculate the amount of the refundable portion of Part I tax. For years starting after 2018, enter the amount from line 450 at amount H in the "Refundable dividend tax on hand" area on page 7 of your return.

### Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand
The calculation of a private corporation's dividend refund is based on two accounts, the eligible refundable dividend tax on hand (ERDTOH) and the non-eligible refundable dividend tax on hand (NERDTOH).

For more information on eligible dividends, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends or see page 94.

**Lines 530 and 545**

The ERDTOH and NERDTOH accounts only apply to corporations that were private or subject corporations, which are defined on page 95.

CCPCs and substantive CCPCs generate NERDTOH on the refundable portion of Part I tax they pay on investment income. They also generate both ERDTOH and NERDTOH on the Part IV tax they pay on dividends they receive. For any other type of private corporation, only the Part IV tax it pays generates ERDTOH and NERDTOH.

For more information on taxable dividends deductible under section 112 or 113, or subsection 138(6), see Line 320 on page 72.

For information on Part IV tax and instructions to complete Schedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable Dividends Paid, and Part IV Tax Calculations, see Line 712 on page 95.

All or part of the ERDTOH and NERDTOH at the end of the tax year may be available as a refund if the corporation pays taxable dividends to the shareholders during the tax year.

You can view the eligible and non-eligible refundable dividend tax on hand balances using the "View return balances" service through:
- My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account, if you are the business owner
- Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if you are an authorized representative or employee

#### Calculating ERDTOH
To calculate the ERDTOH at the end of the tax year, add the following amounts:
- The ERDTOH balance at the end of the previous tax year (minus any dividend refund from ERDTOH issued to the corporation in the previous year) (line 520 minus amount G)
- Any balance of ERDTOH transferred from a predecessor corporation on amalgamation, or from a wound-up subsidiary corporation (line 525)
- Part IV taxes payable (amount Q) on:
  - Eligible dividends received from non-connected corporations
  - Taxable dividends received from connected corporations to the extent that the payment of the dividends caused a dividend refund to the payer corporation from its ERDTOH

#### Calculating NERDTOH
To calculate the NERDTOH at the end of the tax year, add the following amounts:
- The NERDTOH balance at the end of the previous tax year (minus any dividend refund from NERTDOH issued to the corporation in the previous year) (line 535 minus line 575)
- The refundable portion of Part I tax (line 450)
- Any balance of NERDTOH transferred from a predecessor corporation on amalgamation, or from a wound-up subsidiary corporation (line 540)
- Part IV tax payable (excluding amounts allocated to ERDTOH) (amount P)

**Note:** A predecessor corporation or a subsidiary cannot transfer any ERDTOH or NERDTOH to a new or parent corporation as a result of an amalgamation or wind-up if, had the predecessor or subsidiary corporation paid a dividend just before the amalgamation or wind-up, subsection 129(1.2) would have applied to that dividend.

Enter the ERDTOH at the end of the tax year on line 530 and at amount BB in the "Dividend refund" area on page 7 of your return. Enter the NERDTOH at the end of the tax year on line 545 and at amount EE in the same area.

- Subsections 129(4) and 186(5)

### Dividend Refund
A private corporation's eligible dividends generate dividend refunds from the ERDTOH. Non-eligible dividends generate dividend refunds from the NERDTOH first, and then possibly from the ERDTOH. The calculation effectively requires a private corporation to get a refund from its NERDTOH account before it gets a refund from its ERDTOH account, when it pays a non-eligible dividend.

**Important T2 Filing Deadline:** To claim a dividend refund or to apply the amount to another debit for any tax year, including the same tax year, you have to file your income tax return within three years of the end of the tax year. If your income tax return is not filed within three years of the end of the tax year, the dividend refund becomes statute-barred, and will not be issued.

A dividend refund may arise if you pay taxable dividends to shareholders, and if there is an amount of NERDTOH or ERDTOH at the end of the tax year. Taxable dividends paid include the following:
- Stock dividends
- Section 84 deemed dividends
- Amounts paid as interest or dividends on income bonds or debentures that are not deductible when calculating income

To claim a dividend refund, you must make an actual payment to the shareholders unless the dividend is considered paid (a deemed dividend). This payment can be either in cash or with some other tangible assets. In the latter case, the amount of the dividend is the fair market value of the asset transferred.

A private or subject corporation may be entitled to a dividend refund for dividends it paid while it was a private or subject corporation, regardless of whether it was a private or subject corporation at the end of the tax year. If the corporation loses its private status following a change in control, a deemed year-end occurs. The corporation may be allowed to claim a dividend refund for any taxable dividends paid during the deemed short year.

You have to complete parts 3 and 4 (if they apply) of Schedule 3 to claim a dividend refund.

The dividend refund is equal to the total of the following amounts:
- For eligible dividends, the amount (referred to below as amount 1) that is the lesser of 38 1/3% of the total of all eligible dividends you paid in the year and your ERDTOH account balance at the end of the year
- For non-eligible dividends, the total of the two following amounts:
  - The amount that is the lesser of 38 1/3% of the total of all non-eligible dividends you paid in the year and your NERDTOH account balance at the end of the year
  - The amount that is the lesser of:
    - The amount, if any, by which 38 1/3% of the total of all non-eligible dividends you paid in the year is more than your NERDTOH account balance at the end of the year
    - The amount, if any, by which your ERDTOH account balance at the end of the year is more than amount 1

The total of taxable dividends paid in the tax year that qualify for a dividend refund is equal to the amount on line 460 of Schedule 3. Eligible refundable dividend tax on hand refers to line 530 of the return and non-eligible refundable dividend tax on hand refers to line 545.

### Parts 3 and 4 of Schedule 3
The following explains how to complete Parts 3 and 4 of Schedule 3. Parts 1 and 2 are explained on page 96.

If you paid taxable dividends during the year, complete Part 3 to identify taxable dividends that qualify for the dividend refund.

If the amount of dividends paid includes dividends that do not qualify for the dividend refund, you have to deduct these dividends before completing the calculation in Part 3. In this case, complete Part 4 of Schedule 3 to identify dividends that do not qualify.

Dividends that do not qualify are:
- Dividends paid out of the capital dividend account
- Capital gains dividends
- Dividends paid for shares that do not qualify as taxable dividends, because the main purpose of acquiring the shares was to receive a dividend refund [subsection 129(1.2)]
- Taxable dividends paid to a controlling corporation that was bankrupt at any time in the year

Complete Part 3 of Schedule 3 to identify a connected corporation that received taxable dividends that qualify for the dividend refund.

If the dividend refund is more than the amount of Part I tax payable for the year, the CRA deducts the excess from any other taxes owed under the Income Tax Act. Any balance left over is available for a refund.

If the total dividends paid during the year is different from the total of taxable dividends paid for the purpose of the dividend refund, complete Part 4 of Schedule 3.

## Chapter 7 – Page 8 of the T2 Return

### Part I Tax

#### Line 550 – Base Amount of Part I Tax
The basic rate of Part I tax is 38% of taxable income. To determine the base amount of Part I tax, calculate 38% of the taxable income from line 360 of page 3.

On line 550, enter this base amount.

**Reference:** Section 123

#### Line 560 – Additional Tax on Personal Services Business Income (section 123.5)
A corporation must add to its Part I tax payable for a year an amount equal to 5% of the corporation's taxable income for the year from a personal services business.

**Reference:** Section 123.5

#### Line 565 – Additional Tax on Banks and Life Insurers
For tax years that end after April 7, 2022, an additional tax of 1.5% of the taxable income is introduced for members of bank and life insurer groups. The tax applies to any member in the group that is a bank, life insurer or other related financial institution.

A $100 million taxable income exemption could be allocated by agreement amongst group members. For a tax year that includes April 7, 2022, the additional tax would be prorated based on the number of days after April 7, 2022.

To allocate the exemption and calculate the additional tax, complete Schedule 68, Additional Tax on Banks and Life Insurers, and file it with your return. Enter the amount of the additional tax on line 565 of the return.

**Reference:** Section 123.6

#### Line 580 – Total Labour Requirements Addition to Tax
For clean economy investment tax credits (ITCs) other than the clean technology manufacturing ITC, there are consequences for not complying with the labour requirements – prevailing wage requirements and apprenticeship requirements – if you have attested and elected to meet the labour requirements and claimed the credit at the regular rate.

**Addition to Tax for Prevailing Wages Not Paid**
You will be liable to pay a dollar amount per day for each day in the installation tax year, for each covered worker who was not paid the prevailing wage, except when gross negligence applies. The dollar amount will be $20 in 2023 and will be adjusted for inflation in each calendar year after 2023.

You may also be liable to pay a corrective measure in the form of a top-up amount to each covered worker as per notification from the minister. This amount is the difference between prevailing wages that were required to have been paid to the covered worker and the amount that the covered worker was actually paid for the year, plus interest.

You have one year after receiving the notification to pay the top-up amount. If you do not pay the top-up amount, you will be liable to pay a penalty of 120% of the top-up amount that was determined for each covered worker.

If you have not been grossly negligent, you will still be able to claim the ITC at the regular credit rate, even if the above addition to tax provisions for prevailing wage applies.

**Addition to Tax for Apprenticeship Hours Not Met**
You will be liable to pay a dollar amount multiplied by the difference between the total hours of labour that were required to be performed by apprentices registered in a Red Seal trade, and the total hours of labour that were actually performed by apprentices registered in Red Seal trades, plus any other hours of labour for which you met the apprenticeship requirements. The dollar amount is $50 in 2023 and will be adjusted for inflation in each calendar year after 2023.

If you have not been grossly negligent, you will still be able to claim the ITC at the regular credit rate, even if the above addition to tax provisions for apprenticeship requirements applies.

Enter the amount of the total addition to tax on line 580 of the return.

#### Line 602 – Recapture of Investment Tax Credit (ITC)

**Scientific Research and Experimental Development**
A corporation that disposed of a property used in scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED), or converted it to commercial use, should report a recapture in its income tax return for the year in which the disposition or conversion occurred.

If you disposed of a property on which you earned SR&ED ITC, the recapture will be whichever is less:
- The ITC earned for the property
- The amount determined by applying the percentage you used in calculating the ITC earned on the property to:
  - The proceeds of disposition of the property if you dispose of it to an arm's length person
  - In any other case, the fair market value of the property

If you did the SR&ED and transferred the qualified expenditures to a non-arm's length party according to an agreement as described in subsection 127(13), the recapture will be whichever is less:
- The ITC earned by the transferee on the qualified expenditures for the property that was transferred
- The amount determined by the formula: A × B – C
  where:
  - "A" is the percentage that the transferee used in determining its ITC
  - "B" is the proceeds of disposition of the property if you dispose of it to an arm's length person, or in any other case, the fair market value of the property
  - "C" is the amount, if any, added to the tax payable under subsection 127(27) for the property. This allows for the situation where you transferred only a portion of the cost of the property in an agreement under subsection 127(13)

If you transferred a portion of the expenditures and claimed a portion of that expenditure for ITC purposes, both calculations will apply.

The recapture period for ITCs is 20 years.

For more information, see parts 16 and 17 of Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, on how to calculate the recapture of SR&ED ITC or go to canada.ca/taxes-sred.

**Child Care Spaces**
**Note:** The ITC for child care spaces is eliminated for expenditures incurred after March 21, 2017. See page 90.

The ITC for child care spaces will be added to the taxpayer's tax otherwise payable if, at any time within the 60 months of the day on which the taxpayer acquired the property:
- The new child care space is no longer available, or
- Eligible property for purposes of this credit is sold or leased to another person or converted to another use

If the property disposed of is a child care space, the amount to be recaptured will be the amount that can reasonably be considered to have been included in the original ITC.

For eligible expenditures, the amount to be recaptured will be the lesser of:
- The amount that can reasonably be considered to have been included in the original ITC
- 25% of the proceeds of disposition of the eligible property or of its fair market value at the time of disposition, if the property was disposed of to a non-arm's length person

Use Schedule 31 to calculate the recapture of ITC.

**Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits**
Enter the amount of the recapture for each clean economy ITC (except for the CCUS ITC) in Part 25 of Schedule 31. The amounts are determined on the credit calculation schedules for each clean economy ITC. For more information on recapture, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax-credits/clean-economy-itc.

On line 602, enter the total amount of recaptured ITC.

#### Line 604 – Refundable Tax on CCPC's Investment Income
An additional refundable tax of 10 2/3% is levied on the investment income (other than deductible dividends) of a corporation that is a CCPC throughout a tax year and, for tax years starting after April 6, 2022, that is a substantive CCPC at any time in the tax year.

The additional tax may be part of the refundable portion of Part I tax on line 450 and would be added to the non-eligible refundable dividend tax on hand (NERDTOH) pool. Amounts added to the NERDTOH pool will be refunded when taxable dividends (other than eligible dividends) are paid to shareholders (at a rate of 38 1/3% of such dividends paid).

A CCPC (or a substantive CCPC to which the additional tax applies) with investment income has to calculate this additional tax on page 8 and enter the amount on line 604.

**References:**
- Section 123.3
- Subsections 129(1) and 129(4)

#### Line 608 – Federal Tax Abatement
The federal tax abatement is equal to 10% of taxable income earned in the year in a Canadian province or territory. The federal tax abatement reduces Part I tax payable.

Income earned outside Canada is not eligible for the federal tax abatement.

On line 608, enter the amount of federal tax abatement.

**Reference:** Section 124

#### Line 616 – Manufacturing and Processing Profits Deduction and Zero-Emission Technology Manufacturing Deduction
Corporations that derive at least 10% of their gross revenue for the year from manufacturing or processing goods in Canada for sale or lease can claim the manufacturing and processing profits deduction (MPPD). The MPPD reduces Part I tax otherwise payable.

The MPPD applies to the part of taxable income that represents Canadian manufacturing and processing profits. Calculate the MPPD at the rate of 13% on income that is not eligible for the small business deduction (SBD).

**Zero-Emission Technology Manufacturing Deduction**
A temporary measure reduces the corporate tax rates for manufacturers of qualified zero-emission technology for tax years starting after 2021. Income that would otherwise be subject to the 15% general corporate rate is now taxed at a 7.5% rate. Income that would otherwise be taxed at the 9% small-business rate is now taxed at a 4.5% rate.

The temporary measure has been extended by three years. The reduced rates will be gradually phased out starting in tax years that begin in 2032 and fully phased out for tax years that begin after 2034, as follows:

| Tax Year Start | Small Business Rate | Other Rate |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| 2022 to 2031  | 4.5%                | 7.5%       |
| 2032           | 5.625%              | 9.375%     |
| 2033           | 6.75%               | 11.25%     |
| 2034           | 7.875%              | 13.125%    |
| 2035 and later | 9%                  | 15%        |

At least 10% of the corporation's gross revenue from all active businesses carried on in Canada must be derived from eligible activities. Eligible activities include things such as:
- Manufacturing of energy conversion equipment (for example, solar, wind, water, and geothermal equipment)
- Manufacturing of air-source heat pumps used for space or water heating
- Most manufacturing activities around zero-emission vehicles (for example, manufacturing of vehicles, batteries and charging stations)
- For tax years starting after 2023, the following nuclear manufacturing and processing activities:
  - Manufacturing of nuclear energy equipment
  - Processing or recycling of nuclear fuels and heavy water
  - Manufacturing of nuclear fuel rods

Use Schedule 27, Calculation of Canadian Manufacturing and Processing Profits Deduction, to calculate the manufacturing and processing profits deduction and the zero-emission technology manufacturing deduction.

There are two ways to calculate Canadian manufacturing and processing profits: a simplified method for small manufacturing corporations, and a basic labour and capital employed in qualified activities formula for other corporations. These methods are outlined in parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 27.

**Note:** The new reduced tax rate for zero-emission technology applies only to the corporation's zero-emission technology manufacturing profits, defined in subsection 125.2(2) of the Act. These profits are equal to the corporation's adjusted business income multiplied by the proportion of its total labour and capital cost that are used in zero emission technology manufacturing.

Small manufacturing corporations only have to complete Part 1 of Schedule 27 and are entitled to calculate the MPPD on their entire adjusted business income. Essentially, a corporation's adjusted business income is its income from an active business it carried on in Canada that is more than its losses from similar businesses. If the corporation is involved in resource activities, it has to reduce the adjusted business income by its net resource income, its refund interest, and part of its prescribed resource loss.

Schedule 27 shows how to calculate the adjusted business income.

To qualify as a small manufacturing corporation, you have to meet all of the following requirements:
- The activities during the year were mainly manufacturing or processing
- The active business income and that of any associated Canadian corporations was not more than $200,000
- You were not engaged in any activities specifically excluded from manufacturing and processing, as defined in subsection 125.1(3), such as farming, fishing, logging, construction, operating an oil or gas well or extracting
