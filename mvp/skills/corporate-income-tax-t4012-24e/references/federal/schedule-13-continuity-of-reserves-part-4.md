## Schedule 8 - Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) Calculation Examples

### Example 2: Recapture of CCA
A clothing company bought a sewing machine on February 1, 2021, for $15,000. The machine qualified for the accelerated investment incentive. Now, because of the company's overwhelming success in the retail end of the business, it has decided to concentrate solely on retailing. As a result, the company sold its sewing machine in 2024 for $18,000 (but the proceeds of disposition in column 8 cannot be more than $15,000, the capital cost). At the beginning of 2024, the undepreciated capital cost of the sewing machine was $6,720.

The company's Schedule 8 for its 2024 tax year looks like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 8 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $6,720 |
| 3 | Cost of acquisitions during the year (new property must be available for use) | |
| 4 | Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) | |
| 5 | Adjustments and transfers (show amounts that will reduce the undepreciated capital cost in brackets) | |
| 6 | Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 7 | Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | $15,000 |
| 9 | Proceeds of dispositions of the DIEP (enter amount from column 8 that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | ($8,280) |
| 11 | UCC of the DIEP (enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 12 | Immediate expensing | |
| 13 | Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class (column 3 minus column 12) | |
| 14 | Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive properties (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56 | |
| 15 | Remaining UCC (column 10 minus column 12) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 16 | Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (column 8 plus column 6 minus column 13 plus column 14 minus column 7) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 17 | Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 14 minus column 16) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 18 | UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 17 multiplied by the relevant factor) | |
| 19 | UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (0.5 multiplied by the result of column 13 minus column 14 minus column 6 plus column 7 minus column 8) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 20 | CCA rate % | |
| 21 | Recapture of CCA | $8,280 |
| 22 | Terminal loss | |
| 23 | CCA (for declining balance method, the result of column 15 plus column 18 minus column 19, multiplied by column 20, or a lower amount, plus column 12) | |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | n/a |

The amount in column 21 is the recapture of CCA. The clothing company includes the $8,280 recapture in its income (line 107 of Schedule 1). The capital gain is $18,000 minus $15,000, which equals $3,000.

### Example 3: 50% Rule
In the 2024 tax year, a bookstore bought a photocopier for $10,000 to help keep up with the paperwork, and started using it right away. The vendor was a non-arm's length person who has claimed CCA for the photocopier in a prior tax year. The photocopier is then not considered AIIP. The bookstore has to apply the 50% rule when it calculates the amount of CCA it can deduct for its tax year ending in 2024.

The bookstore's Schedule 8 for its 2024 tax year looks like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 8 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $14,000 |
| 3 | Cost of acquisitions during the year (new property must be available for use) | $10,000 |
| 4 | Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) | |
| 5 | Adjustments and transfers (show amounts that will reduce the undepreciated capital cost in brackets) | |
| 6 | Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 7 | Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | |
| 9 | Proceeds of dispositions of the DIEP (enter amount from column 8 that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | $24,000 |
| 11 | UCC of the DIEP (enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 12 | Immediate expensing | |
| 13 | Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class (column 3 minus column 12) | $10,000 |
| 14 | Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive properties (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56 | |
| 15 | Remaining UCC (column 10 minus column 12) (if negative, enter "0") | $24,000 |
| 16 | Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (column 8 plus column 6 minus column 13 plus column 14 minus column 7) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 17 | Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 14 minus column 16) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 18 | UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 17 multiplied by the relevant factor) | |
| 19 | UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (0.5 multiplied by the result of column 13 minus column 14 minus column 6 plus column 7 minus column 8) (if negative, enter "0") | $5,000 |
| 20 | CCA rate % | 20 |
| 21 | Recapture of CCA | |
| 22 | Terminal loss | |
| 23 | CCA (for declining balance method, the result of column 15 plus column 18 minus column 19, multiplied by column 20, or a lower amount, plus column 12) | $3,800 |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | $20,200 |

### Example 4: Accelerated Investment Incentive Property
A grocery store bought refrigeration equipment to store fruits and vegetables for $20,000 during its 2021 tax year and before April 19, 2021.

All properties bought during the tax year qualify for the accelerated investment incentive and are referred to as AIIP. They are included in columns 3 and 13, and reported separately in column 14.

The amount of AIIP subject to the CCA deduction is $20,000 plus an additional relevant factor of 50% (calculated in column 18) for a total amount of $30,000. AIIP are also not subject to the half-year rule.

Without the accelerated investment incentive, the amount of property bought during the tax year subject to the CCA deduction would be $10,000 as the half-year rule would apply.

The accelerated investment incentive allows the grocery store to claim up to three times the amount of CCA otherwise deductible in the first year.

The grocery store's Schedule 8 for its 2021 tax year looks like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 8 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $45,000 |
| 3 | Cost of acquisitions during the year (new property must be available for use) | $20,000 |
| 4 | Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) | |
| 5 | Adjustments and transfers (show amounts that will reduce the undepreciated capital cost in brackets) | |
| 6 | Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 7 | Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | |
| 9 | Proceeds of dispositions of the DIEP (enter amount from column 8 that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | $65,000 |
| 11 | UCC of the DIEP (enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 12 | Immediate expensing | |
| 13 | Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class (column 3 minus column 12) | $20,000 |
| 14 | Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive properties (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56 | $20,000 |
| 15 | Remaining UCC (column 10 minus column 12) (if negative, enter "0") | $65,000 |
| 16 | Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (column 8 plus column 6 minus column 13 plus column 14 minus column 7) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 17 | Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 14 minus column 16) (if negative, enter "0") | $20,000 |
| 18 | UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 17 multiplied by the relevant factor) | $10,000 |
| 19 | UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (0.5 multiplied by the result of column 13 minus column 14 minus column 6 plus column 7 minus column 8) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 20 | CCA rate % | 20 |
| 21 | Recapture of CCA | |
| 22 | Terminal loss | |
| 23 | CCA (for declining balance method, the result of column 15 plus column 18 minus column 19, multiplied by column 20, or a lower amount, plus column 12) | $15,000 |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | $50,000 |

### Example 5: AIIP and Non-AIIP
A potato producer bought tractors for $200,000 during its 2021 tax year and before April 19, 2021. The purchase includes tractors for $50,000 that do not qualify for the accelerated investment incentive because the producer bought them from a non-arm's length person who has claimed CCA for them.

Properties that qualify for the accelerated investment incentive are referred to as AIIP and equal to $150,000. They are included in column 13 and reported separately in column 14.

The amount of AIIP subject to the CCA deduction is $150,000, plus an additional relevant factor of 50% (calculated in column 18) for a total amount of $225,000. AIIP is not subject to the half-year rule.

Properties bought during the year that are not AIIP ($50,000, which is the difference between columns 13 and 14) are not eligible for any enhancement from column 18 and are subject to the half-year rule calculation in column 19.

The producer's Schedule 8 for its 2021 tax year looks like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 10 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $450,000 |
| 3 | Cost of acquisitions during the year (new property must be available for use) | $200,000 |
| 4 | Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) | |
| 5 | Adjustments and transfers (show amounts that will reduce the undepreciated capital cost in brackets) | |
| 6 | Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 7 | Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | |
| 9 | Proceeds of dispositions of the DIEP (enter amount from column 8 that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | $650,000 |
| 11 | UCC of the DIEP (enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 12 | Immediate expensing | |
| 13 | Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class (column 3 minus column 12) | $200,000 |
| 14 | Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive properties (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56 | $150,000 |
| 15 | Remaining UCC (column 10 minus column 12) (if negative, enter "0") | $650,000 |
| 16 | Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (column 8 plus column 6 minus column 13 plus column 14 minus column 7) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 17 | Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 14 minus column 16) (if negative, enter "0") | $150,000 |
| 18 | UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 17 multiplied by the relevant factor) | $75,000 |
| 19 | UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (0.5 multiplied by the result of column 13 minus column 14 minus column 6 plus column 7 minus column 8) (if negative, enter "0") | $25,000 |
| 20 | CCA rate % | 30 |
| 21 | Recapture of CCA | |
| 22 | Terminal loss | |
| 23 | CCA (for declining balance method, the result of column 15 plus column 18 minus column 19, multiplied by column 20, or a lower amount, plus column 12) | $210,000 |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | $440,000 |

### Example 6: Designated Immediate Expensing Property (DIEP)
A new corporation that is a CCPC decides to start manufacturing cars. On May 1, 2023, it bought eligible machinery and equipment for $1.2 million. The corporation is not associated with any other eligible person or partnership (EPOP) during the tax year.

All properties bought during the tax year qualify for the immediate expensing incentive and are referred to as DIEP. Those properties are included in column 3 and reported separately in column 4.

The amount of immediate expensing allowed is the lesser of the immediate expensing limit ($1.5 million) and the UCC of the DIEP ($1.2 million) for $1.2 million. DIEPs are also not subject to the half-year rule.

In this scenario, the immediate expensing incentive allows the corporation to write off the full cost of the asset in the first year.

The company's Schedule 8 for its 2023 tax year looks like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 43 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $0 |
| 3 | Cost of acquisitions during the year (new property must be available for use) | $1,200,000 |
| 4 | Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) | $1,200,000 |
| 5 | Adjustments and transfers (show amounts that will reduce the undepreciated capital cost in brackets) | |
| 6 | Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 7 | Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | |
| 9 | Proceeds of dispositions of the DIEP (enter amount from column 8 that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | $1,200,000 |
| 11 | UCC of the DIEP (enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | $1,200,000 |
| 12 | Immediate expensing | $1,200,000 |
| 13 | Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class (column 3 minus column 12) | |
| 14 | Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive properties (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56 | |
| 15 | Remaining UCC (column 10 minus column 12) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 16 | Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (column 8 plus column 6 minus column 13 plus column 14 minus column 7) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 17 | Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 14 minus column 16) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 18 | UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 17 multiplied by the relevant factor) | |
| 19 | UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (0.5 multiplied by the result of column 13 minus column 14 minus column 6 plus column 7 minus column 8) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 20 | CCA rate % | |
| 21 | Recapture of CCA | |
| 22 | Terminal loss | |
| 23 | CCA (for declining balance method, the result of column 15 plus column 18 minus column 19, multiplied by column 20, or a lower amount, plus column 12) | $1,200,000 |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | |

### Example 7: DIEP and Non-DIEP
A corporation with a tax year starting on July 1, 2023, and ending on June 30, 2024, purchased eligible machinery and equipment on July 1, 2023, for $1 million and July 15, 2023, for $1.8 million. Properties purchased on July 1, 2023, became available for use on February 1, 2024, while properties purchased on July 15, 2023, became available for use on the purchase date. All properties qualify for the accelerated investment incentive. The corporation is not associated with any other eligible person or partnership (EPOP) during the tax year.

DIEPs are properties the corporation acquires after April 18, 2021, that become available for use before 2024. Therefore, the total cost of DIEPs would be $1.8 million. Those properties are included in column 3 and reported separately in column 4.

The amount of immediate expensing allowed is the lesser of the immediate expensing limit ($1.5 million) and the UCC of the DIEP ($1.8 million) for $1.5 million. The remaining $1.3 million, which is made of property not eligible for the DIEP designation (the asset purchased on July 1, 2023, for $1 million) and the remaining portion of the DIEP not eligible for the immediate expensing ($300,000, which is the difference between the UCC of the DIEP of $1.8 million and the $1.5 million immediate expensing), is eligible for the accelerated investment incentive.

The amount of AIIP subject to the CCA deduction is $1.3 million plus an additional relevant factor of 50% (calculated in column 18) for a total amount of $1,950,000, on which the CCA rate of 30% is applied for a result of $585,000. The immediate expensing of $1.5 million is added to that amount to get a total CCA deduction of $2,085,000 in column 23.

The corporation's schedule 8 on June 30, 2024, would look like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 43 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $0 |
| 3 | Cost of acquisitions during the year (new property must be available for use) | $2,800,000 |
| 4 | Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) | $1,800,000 |
| 5 | Adjustments and transfers (show amounts that will reduce the undepreciated capital cost in brackets) | |
| 6 | Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 7 | Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition | |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | |
| 9 | Proceeds of dispositions of the DIEP (enter amount from column 8 that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | $2,800,000 |
| 11 | UCC of the DIEP (enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4) | $1,800,000 |
| 12 | Immediate expensing | $1,500,000 |
| 13 | Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class (column 3 minus column 12) | $1,300,000 |
| 14 | Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive properties (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56 | $1,300,000 |
| 15 | Remaining UCC (column 10 minus column 12) (if negative, enter "0") | $1,300,000 |
| 16 | Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (column 8 plus column 6 minus column 13 plus column 14 minus column 7) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 17 | Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 14 minus column 16) (if negative, enter "0") | $1,300,000 |
| 18 | UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year (column 17 multiplied by the relevant factor) | $650,000 |
| 19 | UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (0.5 multiplied by the result of column 13 minus column 14 minus column 6 plus column 7 minus column 8) (if negative, enter "0") | |
| 20 | CCA rate % | 30 |
| 21 | Recapture of CCA | |
| 22 | Terminal loss | |
| 23 | CCA (for declining balance method, the result of column 15 plus column 18 minus column 19, multiplied by column 20, or a lower amount, plus column 12) | $2,085,000 |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | $715,000 |
