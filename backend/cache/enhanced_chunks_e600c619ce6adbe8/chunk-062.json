Round according to CRA specifications (typically to nearest dollar)\n\n### Validation Rules\nEnsure your application validates:\n- All required fields are completed\n- Numerical values are within acceptable ranges\n- Calculations follow the correct order of operations\n- Special cases (connected corporations, exempt dividends) are properly handled\n\n### Integration Points\nThese calculations should integrate with:\n- T2 Corporation Income Tax Return\n- Schedule 43 calculations\n- General tax reduction calculations\n- Refundable dividend tax on hand (RDTOH) computations",
