  "enhanced_content": "## Section 34.2 Reporting Requirements\n\n### Schedule 73 and Schedule 6 Coordination\nCorporations must ensure consistency between Schedule 73 and Schedule 6 when reporting taxable capital gains. Specifically:\n\n- The amount entered on line 275 of Schedule 73 (total taxable capital gains under section 34.2) must be identical to the corresponding amount reported on Schedule 6\n- This cross-referencing ensures accurate calculation of taxable income and prevents discrepancies in tax assessments\n\n**Example:** If Corporation A reports $50,000 in taxable capital gains on line 275 of Schedule 73, the same $50,000 must be reported on Schedule 6. Failure to match these amounts may trigger CRA reviews and potential penalties.\n\n**References:** Sections 34.2, 34.3, and 249.1\n\n## Late Filing Penalties\n\n### Standard Late Filing Penalties\nWhen a corporation files its T2 return after the deadline, the following penalties apply:\n\n- Base penalty: 5% of unpaid tax at the filing deadline\n- Additional penalty: 1% of unpaid tax for each complete month the return is late (maximum 12 months)\n\n**Example:** Corporation B owes $100,000 in taxes and files 4 months late. The penalty would be:\n- Base penalty: $5,000 (5% of $100,000)\n- Additional penalty: $4,000 (1% × 4 months × $100,000)\n- Total penalty: $9,000\n\n### Enhanced Penalties for Repeat Late Filers\nIf the CRA issued a demand to file under subsection 150(2) and assessed a failure-to-file penalty in any of the three previous tax years:\n\n- Base penalty: 10% of unpaid tax at the filing deadline\n- Additional penalty: 2% of unpaid tax for each complete month the return is late (maximum 20 months)\n\n**Example:** Corporation C owes $100,000 in taxes, has a history of late filing, and files 4 months late. The penalty would be:\n- Base penalty: $10,000 (10% of $100,000)\n- Additional penalty: $8,000 (2% × 4 months × $100,000)\n- Total penalty: $18,000\n\n**References:** Subsections 162(1) and 162(2)\n\n### Non-resident Corporation Penalties\nNon-resident corporations face penalties equal to the greater of:\n- The amount calculated under subsections 162(1) or (2) (as described above)\n- The greater of $100 or $25 for each complete day the return is late (maximum 100 days)\n\n**Example:** Non-resident Corporation D files 30 days late with $50,000 in unpaid tax:\n- Standard penalty calculation: $5,000 (5% of $50,000) + $1,500 (1% × 30 days × $50,000) = $6,500\n- Alternative calculation: $25 × 30 days = $750\n- Applied penalty: $6,500 (greater of the two calculations)\n\n**Reference:** Subsection 162(2.1)\n\n### Large Corporation Penalties\nLarge corporations (taxable capital > $10 million) face additional penalties for late filing of T2 returns and Schedule 38:\n\n- Penalty per month: 0.0005% of taxable capital employed in Canada + 0.25% of Part VI tax payable\n- Maximum period: 40 months\n\n**Example:** Large Corporation E with $500 million taxable capital and $1 million Part VI tax files 5 months late:\n- Monthly penalty: ($500,000,000 × 0.0005%) + ($1,000,000 × 0.25%) = $2,500 + $2,500 = $5,000\n- Total penalty: $5,000 × 5 months = $25,000\n\n**Note:** A corporation is considered large if its total taxable capital employed in Canada (including related corporations) exceeds $10 million. Use Schedule 33, 34, or 35 to determine this.\n\n**Reference:** Section 235\n\n## Other Compliance Penalties\n\n### Mandatory Electronic Filing Penalties\nCorporations required to file electronically but fail to do so face a $1,000 penalty.\n\n**Reference:** Subsection 162(7.2)\n\n### Failure to Report Income Penalties\nWhen a corporation fails to report an amount of $500 or more in the current year or any of the three previous years:\n\n- Penalty equals the lesser of:\n  - 10% of the unreported amount\n  - 50% of the difference between understated tax payable and tax withheld on the unreported amount\n\n**Example:** Corporation F fails to report $10,000 of income, resulting in $2,000 of additional tax payable and $500 of tax withheld:\n- 10% of unreported amount: $1,000\n- 50% of difference: 50% × ($2,000 - $500) = $750\n- Applied penalty: $750 (lesser of the two amounts)\n\n**Note:** This penalty doesn't apply if the corporation is already liable under subsection 163(2) for the same amount.\n\n**References:** Subsections 163(1) and 163(1.1)\n\n### False Statements or Omissions Penalties\nWhen a corporation knowingly or through gross negligence makes false statements or omissions:\n\n- Penalty equals the greater of:\n  - $100\n  - 50% of the understated tax amount\n\n**Example:** Corporation G makes a false statement resulting in $10,000 of understated tax:\n- Minimum penalty: $100\n- 50% of understated tax: $5,000\n- Applied penalty: $5,000 (greater of the two amounts)\n\n**Note:** If charged under subsection 163(2), the corporation cannot also be charged under subsection 163(1) for the same amount.\n\n**Reference:** Subsection 163(2)\n\n### Third-Party Misrepresentation Penalties\nIndividuals who advise or assist others in filing false returns or knowingly allow submission of false tax information face penalties.\n\n**References:** IC01-1, Third-Party Civil Penalties; Section 163.2\n\n### Tax Debt Avoidance Penalties\nUnder proposed changes effective April 15, 2024:\n\n- New supplementary rules strengthen existing tax debt anti-avoidance provisions\n- Participants in tax debt avoidance planning may be jointly and severally liable for the full avoided tax amount\n- Penalty equals the lesser of:\n  - 50% of the tax attempted to be avoided\n  - $100,000 plus any amount the person or related party is entitled to receive regarding the planning activity\n\n**Reference:** Subsection 160(6)\n\n### Other Information Return Penalties\nThe CRA may assess penalties for late or incomplete filing of various information returns, including:\n\n- Form T106 (Non-Arm's Length Transactions With Non-Residents)\n- T5013 FIN and T5013 SUM (Partnership Returns)\n- T5018 SUM (Contract Payments Summary)\n- Foreign reporting forms (T1134, T1135, T1141, T1142)\n- Form T661 (SR&ED Expenditures Claim)\n\n**References:** Sections 162 and 163.1\n\n## Penalty Relief and Waivers\n\n### Taxpayer Relief Provisions\nThe CRA may cancel or waive penalties and interest when taxpayers cannot meet obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\n**Time limitations:**\n- Relief requests must relate to periods ending within 10 calendar years before the request year\n- For 2024 requests, the tax year must end in 2014 or later\n\n**Submission methods:**\n1.
