Find out if this guide is for you 
 
This guide gives you basic information on how to complete 
the T2 Corporation Income Tax Return. This return is used to 
calculate federal income tax and credits. Corporations that 
have a permanent establishment in any province or 
territory other than Quebec or Alberta also use this return 
to report provincial and/or territorial income taxes and 
credits. Corporations with a permanent establishment in 
Quebec or Alberta must file a separate provincial return.

What’s new 
 
Federal, provincial, and territorial 
budgets for 2024 
New items in this guide are outlined in colour. These 
include changes introduced in the 2024 federal, provincial, 
or territorial budgets. This guide may contain changes that 
had not yet become law at the time of publishing. 
Canada carbon rebate for small 
businesses 
A new refundable tax credit is available to return a portion 
of fuel charge proceeds collected under the federal carbon 
pollution pricing system to eligible Canadian-controlled 
private corporations (CCPCs). 
To be eligible for a Canada carbon rebate for a calendar 
year, a corporation must: 
■ have had no more than a total of 499 employees in all 
provinces in Canada in the calendar year 
■ for the 2019 to 2023 calendar years, file a tax return for its 
2023 tax year by July 15, 2024, and 
■ have been a CCPC at all times in the tax year ending 
in 2023 
The tax credit amount will be: 
■ the total number of persons the CCPC employed in each 
designated province, for each calendar year from 2019 to 
2023, multiplied by 
■ the fuel return the minister of Finance specified for that 
designated province for that calendar year 
The designated provinces are Newfoundland and 
Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. 
CCPCs will not have to apply for this tax credit. Once the 
corporation files a tax return for a tax year ending in 2023, 
the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will determine the 
corporation’s eligibility and, generally, issue the rebate to it. 
For calendar years after 2023, the Canada carbon rebate will 
be determined in a similar way – the CRA will 
automatically calculate the rebate for eligible CCPCs that 
filed a tax return on or before July 15 of the next calendar 
year. 
For the 2024-25 and later fuel charge years: 
■ small businesses that have between 1 and 20 employees 
across Canada would qualify for a minimum payment 
amount as if they had 20 employees 
■ corporations would have their payment amounts 
reduced on a straight-line basis when the number of 
employees across Canada is between 300 and 500. The 
payment amount would be zero once the number of 
employees across Canada reaches 500 
■ the rebate would be newly available to cooperative 
corporations and credit unions 
■ proceeds will continue to be returned automatically to 
eligible corporations through direct deposits and cheques 
from the CRA, separately from CRA tax refunds 
For more information, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency 
/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax 
-credits/canada-carbon-rebate-small-businesses. 
Global minimum tax 
A new global minimum tax was introduced to ensure that 
large multinational enterprises (MNEs) are subject to a 
minimum effective tax rate of at least 15% on their profits in 
each jurisdiction they operate in. Large MNEs are 
entreprises with more than €750 million in worldwide 
revenues on a consolidated group basis. 
The new tax applies to fiscal years starting on or after 
December 31, 2023. Corporations that are subject to this tax 
must file applicable returns separately from their T2 
Corporation Income Tax Return. 
Exempt interest and financing 
expenses on purpose-built residential 
rentals and regulated energy utility 
businesses 
The definition of “exempt interest and financing expenses” 
in subsection 18.2(1) provides an exemption from the 
excessive interest and financing limitation (EIFEL) rules for 
interest and financing expenses (IFE) incurred in respect of 
the financing of certain Canadian public-private 
partnership infrastructure projects. 
Under proposed changes, this definition would be 
amended by adding two elections: 
■ an election to exempt certain IFE incurred before 
January 1, 2036, in respect of arm’s length financing 
used to: 
– build or acquire an eligible purpose-built residential 
rental 
– convert a property into an eligible purpose-built 
residential rental in Canada 
■ an election to exempt IFE incurred in respect of an arm’s 
length borrowing or financing used for the purpose of 
gaining or producing income from a regulated energy 
utility business in Canada 
A purpose-built residential rental would be a building or 
part of a building situated in Canada: 
■ containing either: 
– at least 10 residential rental units (that is, housing units 
used or intended for use as rented residential premises 
and not provided to the travelling or vacationing 
public) 
– at least 4 residential rental units that are private (a unit 
with a private kitchen, bathroom, and living area), and

canada.ca/taxes 
■ in which all or substantially all (90%) of the residential 
rental units would be rented or offered for rent for 
continuous periods of no less than 28 consecutive days 
Manipulation of bankrupt status 
Under proposed changes, the exception to the debt 
forgiveness rules for bankrupt corporations and the loss 
restriction rule applicable to bankrupt corporations will be 
repealed. 
As a result, bankrupt corporations would be subject to the 
general rules that apply to other corporations whose 
commercial debts are forgiven. This change would apply to 
bankruptcy proceedings that started after April 15, 2024. 
Reporting rules for digital platform 
operators 
New reporting requirements have been introduced for 
the 2024 calendar year for platform operators in select 
segments of the digital economy under Part XX (which 
came into force January 1, 2024). Starting in January 2025, 
reporting platform operators have to file an information 
return on sellers using their platform to generate revenue in 
select segments of the platform economy. For more 
information, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs 
/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/reporting 
-rules-digital-platforms. 
Synthetic equity arrangement 
A corporation can generally deduct the amount of any 
dividends received on a share of a corporation resident in 
Canada. However, this is subject to certain limitations. One 
of these limitations is an anti-avoidance rule that denies the 
dividend received deduction in respect of synthetic equity 
arrangements (SEA). The anti-avoidance rule does not 
apply for SEA for which the taxpayer has established that 
no tax-indifferent investor has all or substantially all of the 
risk of loss and opportunity for gain or profit in respect of 
the share. 
Under proposed changes, this anti-avoidance rule would be 
simplified by removing the tax-indifferent investor 
exception (including the exchange traded exception). 
Corporations would therefore be unable to claim the 
deduction for dividends received on a share there is a SEA 
for, without any exceptions. This would apply to dividends 
received after December 31, 2024. 
Withholding for non-resident service 
providers 
Currently, a person who pays a fee, commission, or other 
amount to a non-resident for services provided in Canada 
is required to withhold 15% of the payment and remit it to 
the CRA. Effective on royal assent, the CRA would be able 
to waive this withholding requirement over a specific 
period under certain conditions. See page 11. 
Avoidance of tax debts 
A new supplementary rule was announced to strengthen 
the existing tax debt anti‑avoidance rule that is intended to 
prevent taxpayers from avoiding their tax liabilities by 
transferring their assets to non-arm’s length persons for 
insufficient consideration. 
Under the new supplementary rule, where certain 
conditions are met, the property transferred by the tax 
debtor would be deemed to have been transferred to the 
transferee for the purposes of the tax debt avoidance rule. 
This would ensure that the tax debt avoidance rule applies 
in situations where property has been transferred from a 
tax debtor to a person and, as part of the same transaction 
or series, property has been received by a non-arm’s length 
person. 
In addition, the existing penalty would be extended to tax 
debt avoidance planning that is subject to the 
supplementary rule. The penalty is equal to the lesser of: 
■ 50% of the tax that is attempted to be avoided 
■ $100,000 plus any amount the person, or a related person, 
is entitled to receive or obtain regarding the planning 
activity 
To further enhance the effectiveness of the tax debt 
anti-avoidance rule, it is proposed that taxpayers who 
participate in tax debt avoidance planning would be jointly 
and severally, or solidarily, liable for the full amount of the 
avoided tax debt. This amount would include any portion 
the planner retained as a fee. These measures would apply 
to transactions or series of transactions that occur after 
April 15, 2024. See page 16. 
Reportable and notifiable transactions 
penalty 
The general penalty provision for failure to file an 
information return is removed for reportable or notifiable 
transactions, as there are specific penalty provisions under 
the mandatory disclosure rules (MDR) that apply. This is 
deemed to have come into force on June 22, 2023, which is 
the coming into force date of the specific penalty provisions 
under the MDR. See page 19. 
Non-compliance with information 
requests 
Under proposed changes, effective on royal assent, the 
information gathering provisions would be amended by: 
■ creating a new notice of non-compliance 
■ providing the possibility to require that any required 
information or document be provided under oath 
■ adding a penalty when the CRA issues a compliance 
order or a notice of non-compliance 
■ expanding the rules to stop the reassessment limitation 
clock 
See page 21. 
Excessive interest and financing 
expenses limitation (EIFEL) rules 
New EIFEL rules limit the net amount of interest and 
financing expenses (interest and financing expenses minus

canada.ca/taxes 
interest and financing revenues) that can be deducted by a 
taxpayer that is not an excluded entity. For tax years 
starting on or after January 1, 2024, the limit is generally 
equal to 30% of adjusted taxable income. As a transition 
measure, a ratio of 40% applies to tax years starting on or 
after October 1, 2023, and before January 1, 2024. See 
page 38. 
Non-compliant short-term rentals 
Effective January 1, 2024, any deduction (including capital 
cost allowance deduction in Schedule 8) from income in 
respect of non-compliant short-term rentals is disallowed to 
the extent of a non-compliant amount. See page 41. 
Accelerated capital cost allowance 
(CCA) 
Under proposed changes, an accelerated CCA rate of 10% 
under class 1 would apply to new eligible purpose-built 
rental housing projects that begin construction after 
April 15, 2024, and before 2031, and are available for use 
before 2036. Investments eligible for this measure would 
continue to benefit from the accelerated investment 
incentive (AII), which currently suspends the half-year rule, 
providing a CCA deduction at the full rate for eligible 
property that becomes available for use before 2028. 
Immediate expensing (a 100% first-year deduction) would 
apply to new additions of property to CCA classes 44, 46, 
and 50, if the property is acquired after April 15, 2024, and 
becomes available for use before 2027. Property that 
becomes available for use in 2027 would continue to benefit 
from the AII. 
See page 46. 
Accelerated investment incentive and 
immediate expensing 
Under proposed changes, the accelerated investment 
incentive (AII) and immediate expensing measures for 
certain CCA classes would be reinstated for qualifying 
property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that 
becomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year 
phase out after 2029. See pages 46, 47, and 48. 
Charitable donations 
Deadline 
The deadline for making donations eligible for tax support 
in the 2024 tax year is proposed to be extended until 
February 28, 2025, for tax years ending after 
November 14, 2024, and before 2025. See page 70. 
Receipts 
Effective on registration of the amended Regulation, 
charities will be allowed to issue donation receipts 
electronically, if: 
■ they contain all required information 
■ they are issued in a secure and non-editable format 
■ the charity maintains an electronic copy of the receipts 
See page 70. 
Line 580 – Total labour requirements 
addition to tax 
For clean economy investment tax credits (ITCs) other than 
the clean technology manufacturing ITC, there are 
consequences for not complying with the labour 
requirements if you have attested and elected to meet the 
labour requirements and claimed the credit at the regular 
rate. See page 83. 
Scientific research and experimental 
development 
The Government announced that, for tax years that begin 
on or after December 16, 2024: 
■ the annual expenditure limit on which CCPCs are 
entitled to earn an enhanced 35% investment tax credit 
would increase from $3 million to $4.5 million; 
■ the prior-year taxable capital phase-out thresholds for the 
enhanced credit would increase from $10 million and 
$50 million, to $15 million and $75 million, respectively; 
■ the enhanced refundable SR&ED credit would be 
extended to Canadian public corporations 
For property acquired after December 15, 2024 (or lease 
costs first becoming payable after that date) the pre-2014 
eligibility of capital expenditures would be reinstated to 
both the SR&ED income deduction and the SR&ED ITC. 
Qualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC would 
be entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate 
of 40% on their capital expenditures. See page 89. 
Mutual fund corporation 
Under proposed changes, for tax years starting after 2024, a 
corporation will not qualify as a mutual fund corporation if 
it is controlled by or for the benefit of a corporate group 
(including a corporate group that consists of any 
combination of corporations, individuals, trusts, and 
partnerships that do not deal with each other at arm’s 
length). 
This new rule would not apply to mutual fund corporations 
incorporated within the two previous years and where 
specified persons hold shares with a value of $5 million or 
less. Exceptions would apply to ensure that the measure 
does not adversely affect mutual fund corporations that are 
widely held pooled investment vehicles. See page 138. 
Clean technology ITC 
Under proposed changes, for businesses investing in 
eligible property that is acquired and becomes available for 
use on or after November 21, 2023, eligibility for the credit 
would include systems that produce electricity, heat, or 
both electricity and heat, from eligible waste biomass. See 
page 136.

canada.ca/taxes 
Clean hydrogen ITC 
Under proposed changes, effective for property that is 
acquired and becomes available for use in an eligible 
project on or after December 16, 2024, the clean hydrogen 
ITC would be expanded to include projects that produce 
hydrogen from methane pyrolysis. See page 136. 
Clean technology manufacturing ITC – 
Polymetallic extraction and processing 
Because producing qualifying materials may occur during 
polymetallic projects (projects that produce multiple 
metals), under proposed changes, several adjustments 
would be made to the credit. One of these includes 
changing to a "primarily" test (with 50% rather than 90%) 
for property used in qualifying mineral activities expected 
to produce qualifying materials at mine or well sites. See 
page 137. 
Clean electricity investment tax credit 
Details were provided on the conditions that would need to 
be satisfied in order for a province or territory to be a 
designated jurisdiction, along with annual public reporting 
requirements that will apply to any provincial and 
territorial crown corporations claiming the clean 
electricity ITC. 
Canada Infrastructure Bank 
Under proposed changes, the Canada Infrastructure Bank 
would be included as an eligible entity under the clean 
electricity ITC. Financing provided by the Canada 
Infrastructure Bank to another eligible entity would not 
reduce the capital cost of eligible property for the purpose 
of computing that entity’s clean electricity ITC. These 
measures would apply to eligible property that is acquired 
and that becomes available for use on or after 
December 16, 2024. 
Electric vehicle supply chain ITC 
The Government announced a new 10% electric 
vehicle (EV) supply chain investment tax credit. It would 
apply on the cost of buildings used in key segments of the 
EV supply chain for businesses that invest in Canada across 
three supply chain segments: 
■ electric vehicle assembly 
■ electric vehicle battery production 
■ cathode active material production 
A corporation would have to invest at least $100 million in 
each of the three segments. See page 138.

decreased from 3% to 2.5%. See page 101.

page 106. 
Ontario computer animation and 
special effects (OCASE) tax credit 
For film or television productions for which no specified 
labour costs were incurred before March 26, 2024, an 
eligible production no longer has to qualify for either the 
Ontario film and television tax credit or the Ontario 
production services tax credit to claim the OCASE credit. 
Instead, the corporation has to incur a minimum of $25,000 
in Ontario labour expenditures for each film or television 
production it is claiming the OCASE credit for. See 
page 112. 
Manitoba interactive digital media tax 
credit 
Expenses for eligible projects are to be claimed in the tax 
year in which they were incurred. The requirement that a 
corporation claim the credit on or before its filing due date 
for the tax year is eliminated. Some qualified corporations, 
in certain circumstances, will be exempt from having to 
apply for a certificate of eligibility (pre-approval) before 
project work begins. See page 121. 
Manitoba data processing investment 
tax credits 
These credits are eliminated for the 2025 and later tax years. 
See page 123.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act and the 
Income Tax Regulations of Canada, unless stated otherwise. 
This guide does not replace the Income Tax Act or its 
regulations. 
This guide also refers to information circulars (ICs) and 
interpretation bulletins (ITs) that the CRA publishes to give 
you more technical information. A new series of technical 
publications, called the income tax folios, is progressively 
replacing the interpretation bulletins. This process is taking 
place over several years. To be notified of new or updated 
income tax folios, subscribe to the electronic mailing list

Many of CRA’s publications, including forms, schedules, 
ICs, ITs, and folios are available at canada.ca/cra-forms

CRA’s service pledge 
The CRA will process 95% of T2 corporation income tax 
returns filed electronically within 45 days. 
Find out if you have to file a T2 return 
Resident corporations 
All corporations—including non-profit organizations, 
tax-exempt corporations, and inactive corporations—have 
to file a T2 return for every tax year, even if there is no tax 
payable. The only exceptions to this rule are tax-exempt 
Crown corporations, Hutterite colonies, and corporations 
that were registered charities throughout the year. 
Non-resident corporations 
A non-resident corporation has to file a T2 return if, at any 
time in the year, one of the following situations applies: 
■ it carried on business in Canada 
■ it had a taxable capital gain 
■ it disposed of taxable Canadian property, unless the 
disposition meets all the criteria listed below in the 
section “Dispositions of taxable Canadian property 
(certificates of compliance)” 
This requirement applies even if the corporation claims that 
any profits or gains realized are exempt from Canadian 
income tax due to the provisions of a tax treaty. 
Business is defined in subsection 248(1) and the extended 
meaning of carrying on business (in Canada) is defined in 
section 253. 
The references to taxable capital gain do not include any 
gain resulting from the disposition of shares that are listed 
on a designated stock exchange (other than taxable 
Canadian property). 
A non-resident corporation also has to file a T2 return in a 
number of situations, including: 
■ when it has filed Form NR6, Undertaking to File an Income 
Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real or 
Immovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty, to pay 
Part I tax on the net amount of timber royalty income or 
rental income from real property under subsection 216(4) 
for the current year and the CRA approved it 
■ when it has filed Form T1288, Application by a 
Non-Resident of Canada (Corporation) for a Reduction in the 
Amount of Non-Resident Tax Required to Be Withheld on 
Income Earned from Acting in a Film or Video Production, to 
pay Part I tax on the net amount of acting services 
under subsection 216.1(1) for the current year and the 
CRA approved it 
Even if neither of these requirements applies, a 
non-resident corporation may still want to file a return if 
any of the following situations apply: 
■ when it wants to claim a refund 
■ when it wants to elect to pay Part I tax on the net amount 
of timber royalty income or rental income from real 
property under subsection 216(1) for the current year 
■ when it wants to elect to pay Part I tax on the net amount 
of acting services under subsection 216.1(1) for the 
current year 
Note 
Non-resident corporations must file their T2 return, 
schedules, and the General Index of Financial 
Information in Canadian funds only. They are not 
eligible to file in a functional currency per section 261. 
If you have questions about non-resident returns, go 
to canada.ca/taxes-international-business. 
Dispositions of taxable Canadian property (certificates 
of compliance) 
A non-resident corporation that disposes of taxable 
Canadian property must notify the CRA and may be 
required to get a certificate of compliance under 
section 116. For details, see Information Circular IC72-17, 
Procedures Concerning the Disposition of Taxable Canadian 
Property by Non-residents of Canada – Section 116. 
A non-resident corporation that has a taxable capital gain 
or disposed of taxable Canadian property, including a 
corporation that may have received a certificate of 
compliance from the CRA, has to file a return, unless the 
disposition meets all the following criteria: 
■ no tax is payable under Part I for the tax year 
■ the corporation is not liable to pay any amount under the 
Act for any previous tax year (other than an amount 
covered by adequate security under section 116 or 220) 
■ each taxable Canadian property disposed of in the tax 
year is one of the following: 
– excluded property under section 116 
– property for which a certificate was issued under 
section 116

Taxable Canadian property excludes shares of corporations, 
and certain other interests, that, during the 60-month 
period ending at the time of determination, do not derive 
their value principally from real or immovable property 
situated in Canada (including Canadian resource property 
and timber resource property). 
Non-resident corporations claiming treaty exemption 
If you carried on a treaty-protected business in Canada or 
disposed of a taxable Canadian property that was 
treaty-protected property during the year (as defined in 
section 248), you have to complete all of the following lines 
on your return: 
■ lines 001 to 082 of page 1 
■ lines 164, 170, and 171 of page 2 
■ lines 270 to 289 (except line 271) of page 3 
■ lines 780 to 990, if applicable, of page 9 
For each of the questions asked at lines 164, 170, and 171 
on page 2 of the return to which your response is yes, 
complete the appropriate form or schedule and attach it to 
your return. In addition, you have to complete Schedule 91, 
Information Concerning Claims for Treaty-Based Exemptions. 
Rental income from Canada 
Rental income from Canada is subject to a 25% withholding 
on the gross rental income under Part XIII, unless the rate is 
reduced by a reciprocal tax treaty. A non-resident 
corporation can elect to be taxed under Part I on its net 
rental income by filing a T2 return under subsection 216(1) 
within two years of the end of the tax year. If the 
non-resident corporation has filed Form NR6, Undertaking 
to File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent 
from Real or Immovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty, 
it must file a T2 return under subsection 216(4) within 
six months of the tax year end. For more information, see 
IT393R2 – Election Re: Tax on Rents and Timber Royalties 
Non-Residents. 
Note 
If you file a T2 return under section 216, include only 
rental income. If you have any other income, file a 
second T2 return. 
Reference 
Guide T4144, Income Tax Guide for Electing Under Section 216 
Services rendered in Canada (withholding amount) 
A non-resident corporation is subject to a 15% withholding 
under Regulation 105 on any fee or other amount paid to it 
for services rendered in Canada (regardless of whether the 
services are provided by an employee of the corporation or 
are sub-contracted to another party). This withholding is 
held on account of any potential tax liability that the 
corporation may have to Canada. The corporation’s tax 
liability is determined when its Canadian income tax return 
is assessed. 
Effective on royal assent, the CRA would be able to waive 
this withholding requirement over a specified period if 
either of the following conditions were met: 
■ the non-resident is not subject to Canadian income tax 
for the payments because of a tax treaty between their 
country of residence and Canada 
■ the income from providing the services is exempt income 
from international shipping or from operating an aircraft 
in international traffic 
The minister of National Revenue would have the 
legislative authority to waive the withholding requirement 
on multiple transactions with a single waiver, and to 
establish any conditions and information requirements 
necessary to reduce compliance risks. 
The minister could also revoke the waiver if they are no 
longer satisfied that the conditions are being met. 
A corporation related to a non-resident actor is subject to 
a 23% withholding tax under Part XIII on all amounts it 
receives for the acting services of the actor in a film or video 
production in Canada. This withholding tax represents the 
final tax liability for these acting services. The corporation 
may elect not to be taxed under Part XIII at the 23% rate 
by filing a return of income under Part I for the year. A 
non-resident corporation that has received a reduction 
(filed Form T1288) of this withholding tax from the CRA 
still has to file a return. 
Note 
Send your Canadian T2 return that you elected to file 
under section 216.1 to the tax services office that 
processed application Form T1288 and issued the 
reduction. Write “Actor’s election” at the top of page 1 of 
the return.

How to file your return 
Using tax preparation software 
Over 90% of corporations file their return electronically. To 
do so, you must use CRA-certified software. The CRA 
certifies commercial software to ensure that it meets the 
CRA’s specifications. To find a list of certified software, 
visit Canada.ca and search for “certified software 
corporations.” 
A return prepared by certified software can then be 
electronically filed using: 
■ the CRA’s Corporation Internet Filing service 
■ My Business Account, at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are a business owner 
■ Represent a Client, at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
If you cannot file electronically, you can print the T2 Bar 
Code Return and mail it to the CRA. 
Note 
Do not send the T2 bar code by fax. The CRA does not 
accept it. 
If you file through an electronic transmitter, you have to 
authorize the transmitter by completing Form T183 CORP, 
Information Return for Corporations Filing Electronically, for

each tax year. As of June 22, 2023, Form T183CORP may be 
signed with an electronic signature. 
Do not send this form to the CRA, but keep it in case the 
CRA asks for it later. 
T2 Auto-fill 
T2 Auto-fill is a secure service that lets corporations and 
authorized representatives download information from 
the CRA to their tax preparation software. Using this 
service will ensure that certain return and account balances 
will match CRA’s data. For more information on what 
T2 Auto-fill delivers, go to canada.ca/auto-fill-my 
-t2-return. 
This service is not mandatory for certified software 
products. Some include it and others do not. If you have 
questions on the availability of the service, contact the 
software product company. 
Mandatory electronic filing 
All corporations with annual gross revenue of more than 
$1 million had to file their T2 return electronically, except 
for insurance corporations, non-resident corporations, 
corporations reporting in functional currency, and 
corporations that are exempt from tax payable under 
section 149 of the Income Tax Act. 
This $1 million threshold was eliminated for tax years 
starting after 2023. Most corporations have to file their 
return electronically. 
Corporations that do not file their returns electronically 
when required are subject to a penalty. For more 
information, see page 16. 
References 
Subsection 150.1(2.1) 
Regulation 205.1(2) 
Corporation Internet Filing 
You must use CRA-approved software that has been 
certified for Corporation Internet Filing. By filing 
electronically, you will receive immediate confirmation that 
the CRA has received your return, enjoy faster processing 
and refunds, save on mailing costs, and help the 
environment by using less paper. 
The T2 Attach-a-doc service allows corporations to attach 
supporting documentation such as certificates when they 
file their T2 return or within 24 hours of filing. This service 
is not mandatory for certified software products. Some 
include it and others do not. If you have questions on the 
availability of the service, contact the software product 
company. 
If you are filing your T2 return electronically, and you 
cannot use the T2 Attach-a-doc service to file your 
supporting documents with your return, send them to your 
tax centre (see “Where to file your paper return” on 
page 13). 
When sending paper documents, clearly identify your 
corporation’s name, business number, and the applicable 
tax year-end on the documents. 
If you are filing an election that does not have a prescribed 
form or prescribed manner, include it with the notes to 
your financial statements on the General Index of Financial 
Information (GIFI) to transmit the election electronically 
with your return, unless otherwise stated on a T2-related 
form.

that can be e-filed using commercial tax preparation 
software, go to canada.ca/cra-special-elections-and

and more, go to canada.ca/corporation-internet. 
Filing without a web access code 
You can file corporation returns online without a 
web access code using “Transmit a return” through: 
■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are the business owner 
■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
codes 
All certified tax preparation software for T2 returns uses 
self-identified NAICS codes. 
NAICS codes are hierarchical numerical codes designed to 
provide common definitions and descriptions of our 
industries and business activities. NAICS codes are up to 
six digits long. The Government of Canada as well as the 
governments of the provinces and territories use the data 
provided by NAICS codes for economic analysis and fiscal 
policy responses. 
The integration of NAICS codes into T2 commercial tax 
preparation software packages means that corporations 
have to pick their main revenue-generating business 
activity directly from a drop-down list or a simple search. 
Active corporations that file their T2 returns either by 
Internet or on paper using 2D bar codes must choose the 
appropriate codes to describe their main 
revenue-generating business activity. 
Corporations using the return available on Canada.ca do 
not have to enter a NAICS code. 
Avoid errors 
It is important that you select the most accurate business 
activity the first time, since the first year’s code is carried 
forward to following years, allowing for a simple validation 
of the description when there is no change in the main 
business activity. 
If you do not select the business activity, problems and 
errors will result when you prepare the T2 return to be 
transmitted electronically or printed in bar-coded format. 
If you have any questions on selecting NAICS codes to 
describe your corporation’s main revenue-generating 
business activity when filing your T2 return, call the 
Business Enquiries line at 1-800-959-5525.

within six weeks. For information on processing times, go 
to canada.ca/cra-processing-times. 
If you do not have to file electronically, the CRA has 
two types of corporation return available for printing. 
T2 Corporation Income Tax Return 
The T2 Corporation Income Tax Return has nine pages. Any 
corporation can use it. 
T2 Short Return 
The T2 Short Return is two pages plus a Schedule 1, Net 
Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes. To complete the 
T2 Short, you may also have to complete a Schedule 8, 
Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) and a Schedule 50, Shareholder 
Information. The T2 Short Return is a simpler version of the 
T2 Corporation Income Tax Return. Two categories of 
corporations are eligible to use this return: 
■ You can use this return if the corporation is a 
Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) 
throughout the tax year and this year, it has either a nil 
net income or a loss for income tax purposes. 
■ You can also use this return if the corporation is exempt 
from tax under section 149 (such as a non-profit 
organization). 
In addition, the corporation must meet all of the following 
conditions to use this return: 
■ it has a permanent establishment in only one province or 
territory (see page 98) 
■ it is not claiming any refundable tax credits (other than a 
refund of instalments it paid) 
■ it did not receive or pay out any taxable dividends 
■ it is reporting in Canadian currency 
■ it does not have an Ontario transitional tax debit 
■ it does not have an amount calculated under section 34.2 
If the corporation does not fit into either of the above 
categories or does not meet all of the above conditions, file 
a regular T2 return. 
When to file your return 
File your return within six months of the end of each tax 
year. The tax year of a corporation is its fiscal period. 
When the corporation’s tax year ends on the last day of a 
month, file the return by the last day of the sixth month 
after the end of the tax year. 
When the last day of the tax year is not the last day of a 
month, file the return by the same day of the sixth month 
after the end of the tax year.

When a filing due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or 
public holiday recognized by the CRA, your return is 
considered on time if the CRA receives it or if it is 
postmarked on or before the next business day. Several 
provinces and territories have their own unique holidays. 
Therefore, due dates may be affected depending on where 
you reside. For information on public holidays, go to 
canada.ca/cra-public-holidays. 
You must file your return on time. If you do not, the CRA 
can charge penalties on any return that was not sent by the 
filing due date. See page 15 for details. 
Note 
You must file a return no later than three years after 
the end of a tax year to receive a tax refund. 
Re-appropriation of T2 statute-barred credits 
Under subsection 221.2(1), the minister of National 
Revenue may use discretion to re-appropriate 
T2 statute-barred credits to an established debt on an 
account associated with the same business number and 
administered by the CRA. 
To request the re-appropriation of a T2 statute-barred 
credit, send the CRA a completed Form RC431, Request for 
Re-appropriation of T2 Statute-barred Credits, with all the 
supporting documents. Complete a separate form for each 
unique business number. 
You can also use the “Enquiries service” in My Business 
Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account. You will 
have to provide the same details requested on Form RC431 
in your enquiry. Keep the requested documents in case the 
CRA asks for them later. 
For more information, see the form or go to canada.ca 
/t2-reappropriation. 
Where to file your paper return 
The tax centres in Winnipeg, Sudbury, and Summerside 
process corporation tax returns. To find out where to mail 
your return, go to canada.ca/cra-tso-contact-information or 
call 1-800-959-5525. 
Film and media tax credits 
Film Services Units at the CRA provide services to 
corporations that may be entitled to receive the Canadian 
film or video production tax credit, the film or video 
production services tax credit, or other available provincial 
film or media tax credits. For more information, including 
the location and contact number for the Film Services Unit 
serving your area, go to canada.ca/taxes-film. 
When and how to pay income tax 
Corporations have to pay income tax in monthly or 
quarterly instalments, unless the total of Part I, Part VI, 
Part VI.1, and Part XIII.1 taxes payable for either the 
previous year or the current year is $3,000 or less. 
The balance of tax the corporation owes for a tax year is 
due within either two or three months of the end of that tax 
year, depending on the circumstances of the corporation.

Interest and penalties apply to late payments. To be on 
time, you have to make instalment payments and other 
payments on or before the due date by using one of the 
several methods for making payments: 
■ your Canadian bank or credit union’s online banking, 
mobile app, or telephone service 
■ the CRA’s My Payment service at canada.ca/cra-my 
-payment with your activated debit card from a 
participating Canadian bank or credit union with a 
Visa® Debit or Debit Mastercard® logo (does not include 
credit cards) 
■ pre-authorized debit (PAD) at canada.ca/my-cra 
-business-account which lets you: 
– set up payments to the CRA from a Canadian chequing 
account on preset dates starting in five or more 
business days 
– pay an amount due, repay overpaid amounts or make 
instalment payments 
– view your account history and modify, cancel, or skip 
a payment 
For more information on PAD, go to canada.ca/pay 
-authorized-debit. 
■ the “Proceed to pay” button in the “View and pay 
account balance” page and other pages within My 
Business Account 
■ your credit card, Interac e transfer or PayPal through one 
of the third-party service providers for a fee 
■ in person at a Canadian bank or credit union or, for a fee, 
at Canada Post. To do so, you have to use a remittance 
voucher, which you can request online in 
My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account 
Note 
Remittance vouchers have a Quick Response (QR) code 
printed on them that contains all the information you 
need to pay with cash or debit at a Canada Post retail 
outlet. 
For more information, go to canada.ca/payments or contact 
your financial institution. 
The CRA considers the payment to be made on the day the 
CRA receives it, and not on the day you send it. 
When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public 
holiday recognized by the CRA, for calculating instalment 
interest and penalty, your payment is considered on time if 
the CRA receives it on or before the next business day. 
Several provinces and territories have their own unique 
holidays. Therefore, due dates may be affected depending 
on where you reside. For information on public holidays, 
go to canada.ca/cra-public-holidays. 
Note 
Sometimes, penalties and interest on late payments can 
be cancelled or waived. For more information, see 
“Cancel or waive penalties and interest” on page 17. 
Instalment due dates 
Instalment payments for Parts I, VI, VI.1, and XIII.1 taxes 
are due on the last day of every complete month of a 
corporation’s tax year. The first payment is due one month 
minus a day from the starting date of the corporation’s tax 
year. The rest of the payments are due on the same day of 
each month that follows. 
Eligible small-CCPCs can make quarterly instalment 
payments, instead of monthly ones. For more information, 
see Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation Instalment Guide. 
You can view your instalment due dates by using the 
“Calculate and pay instalment payments” service through: 
■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are the business owner 
■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
Balance-due day 
Generally, all corporation taxes (with the exception of 
Part III and Part XII.6) are due two months after the end of 
the tax year. However, the tax is due three months after the 
end of the tax year if the following conditions apply: 
■ the corporation is a CCPC throughout the tax year; 
■ the corporation is claiming the small business deduction 
for the tax year, or was allowed the small business 
deduction in the previous tax year; and either of the 
following applies: 
– the corporation’s taxable income for the previous tax 
year does not exceed its business limit for that tax year 
(if the corporation is not associated with any other 
corporation during the tax year) 
– the total of the taxable incomes of all the associated 
corporations for their last tax year ending in the 
previous calendar year does not exceed the total of 
their business limits for those tax years (if the 
corporation is associated with any other corporation 
during the tax year) 
The business limit is provided at “Line 410 – Business 
limit” on page 77. For more information about allocating 
the business limit among associated corporations, see 
“Schedule 23” on page 33. 
Note 
For determining balance-due days, the taxable income 
for the previous year of corporations and associated, 
subsidiary, and predecessor corporations means taxable 
income before applying loss carrybacks. 
Special rules apply to determine the balance-due day of a 
new corporation formed after an amalgamation or of a 
parent corporation after it receives the assets of a subsidiary 
corporation that is winding-up. For more information, go

Partnerships – Limiting deferral of 
corporation tax 
Under section 34.2, a corporation may have to accrue 
additional income in respect of a partnership (other than 
dividends for which a deduction is available under 
section 112 or 113), when the fiscal period of the 
partnership begins in the corporation’s tax year and ends in 
a following tax year. The corporation is then required to 
accrue income under the adjusted stub period accrual 
(ASPA) regime for the portion of the partnership’s fiscal 
period that falls in the corporation’s tax year (the stub 
period). These rules do not affect a corporation’s capital 
dividend account which is to be determined without 
reference to section 34.2. 
Since the ASPA income inclusion in a tax year is an 
estimate of the stub period income, the corporation is 
entitled to claim that same amount in the immediately 
following tax year. Both the ASPA income inclusion and 
the treatment of that same amount in the following year are 
subject to the characterization rules under 
subsection 34.2(5). They are deemed to have the same 
character and be in the same proportions as the partnership 
income that they relate to. As such, the claim in the 
immediately following tax year may be a deduction or a 
deemed allowable capital loss, whichever applies. A 
corporation may have ASPA in respect of more than one 
partnership and, in such cases, the ASPA rules apply to the 
corporation on a partnership-by-partnership basis. 
In general, a corporation (other than a professional 
corporation) has to include in its income for a tax year its 
ASPA for a partnership if all of the following apply: 
■ the corporation has a significant interest in the 
partnership at the end of the last fiscal period of the 
partnership that ends in the tax year 
■ another fiscal period of the partnership begins in the tax 
year and ends after the tax year of the corporation 
■ at the end of the tax year, the corporation is entitled to a 
share of an income, loss, taxable capital gain, or 
allowable capital loss of the partnership for the fiscal 
period referred to in the preceding bullet 
A corporation has a significant interest in a partnership if 
the corporation, or the corporation together with affiliated 
or related parties, is entitled to more than 10% of the 
partnership’s income or loss (or assets, net of liabilities, if 
the partnership were to cease to exist). 
These rules apply to any corporation (described above), 
that is a member of a partnership, even if the partnership 
has a member that is an individual or a professional 
corporation that is subject to the 1995 rules limiting deferral 
for unincorporated businesses. 
The definition of adjusted stub period accrual in 
subsection 34.2(1) gives the formulas for calculating a 
corporation’s ASPA in respect of a partnership. The ASPA 
formula allows the corporation to designate two reductions. 
The first designation concerns qualified resource expenses 
incurred by the partnership during the corporation’s stub 
period. The second allows a corporate partner to make a 
discretionary designation to reduce its ASPA to reflect its 
knowledge of the actual partnership income for the stub 
period. Once filed, the designations cannot be amended or 
revoked. If the amount of the discretionary designation is 
too high, creating an income shortfall, the corporation may 
be subject to an additional income inclusion. The additional 
income inclusion may increase if the shortfall is above 
a 25% threshold. 
Under certain conditions, a corporation (other than a 
professional corporation) that becomes a member of a 
partnership in a tax year may make a designation to 
apportion its income from the partnership between two tax 
years: 
■ the tax year in which the fiscal period of the partnership 
began 
■ the tax year in which the fiscal period of the partnership 
ends 
To calculate the income inclusion under section 34.2 and, if 
applicable, the income shortfall adjustment and additional 
amount under section 34.3, use Schedule 71, Income 
Inclusion for Corporations that Are Members of Single-Tier 
Partnerships, or Schedule 72, Income Inclusion for Corporations 
that Are Members of Multi-Tier Partnerships. These are 
worksheets and you do not have to file them with your 
return. To report the amounts, file a completed Schedule 73, 
Income Inclusion Summary for Corporations that Are Members 
of Partnerships, with your return. 
Note 
Schedules 1, 6, and 7 are affected by the various rules in 
section 34.2 and the amounts reported on Schedule 73 
(as applicable). For example, the amount entered on 
line 275 of Schedule 73 reporting the total taxable capital 
gains under section 34.2 must also be entered on 
Schedule 6.

Penalties 
If you file your return late 
If you file your return late, a penalty applies. The penalty 
is 5% of the unpaid tax that is due on the filing deadline, 
plus 1% of this unpaid tax for each complete month that 
the return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months. 
The corporation will be charged an even larger penalty if 
the CRA issued a demand to file the return under 
subsection 150(2) and if it assessed a failure to file penalty 
for the corporation in any of the three previous tax years. 
The penalty is 10% of the unpaid tax when the return was 
due, plus 2% of this unpaid tax for each complete month 
that the return is late, up to a maximum of 20 months.

Subsection 162(2.1) 
Large corporations 
A large corporation has to file the T2 Corporation Income Tax 
Return and, if applicable, a Schedule 38, Part VI Tax on 
Capital of Financial Institutions. If a corporation fails to file 
these returns, in addition to any other penalty as applicable, 
the CRA will charge a penalty for each complete month that 
the returns are late, up to a maximum of 40 months. The 
penalty will be the sum of the following amounts: 
■ 0.0005% of the corporation’s taxable capital employed in 
Canada (within the meaning assigned in Part I.3) at the 
end of tax year 
■ 0.25% of the Part VI tax payable by the corporation 
[before the deductions in subsection 190.1(3)] 
To identify the corporation as a large corporation, answer 
yes to the question at line 233 on page 2 of the return. 
Notes 
A corporation is a large corporation if the total taxable 
capital employed in Canada at the end of the tax year by 
it and its related corporations is over $10 million. 
To determine if the total taxable capital employed in 
Canada of the corporation and its related corporations is 
greater than $10 million use whichever one of the 
following schedules that applies: 
– Schedule 33, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large 
Corporations 
– Schedule 34, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – 
Financial Institutions 
– Schedule 35, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large 
Insurance Corporations 
A corporation with a permanent establishment in 
Newfoundland and Labrador that is a financial 
institution, as defined under provincial legislation, has 
to file Schedule 305, Newfoundland and Labrador 
Capital Tax on Financial Institutions. See page 101. 
For tax years starting after October 31, 2021, a 
corporation with a permanent establishment in Nova 
Scotia at any time in the tax year that is a financial 
institution, as defined under provincial legislation, has 
to file Schedule 352, Nova Scotia Financial Institutions 
Capital Tax. See page 106. 
If schedules 305 or 352 are not filed, the corporation will 
be liable to a penalty similar to the one for failure to file 
Schedule 38 (described above), in addition to any other 
penalty.

If you do not comply with mandatory 
electronic filing

If you do not report income 
The CRA will charge a penalty if a corporation does not 
report an amount equal to or greater than $500 that is 
required to be included in computing its income on its 
return in a tax year and any of the three previous tax years. 
This penalty will not be applied if the corporation is liable 
under subsection 163(2) for the same unreported amount. 
The repeated failure to report income penalty is equal to the 
lesser of: 
■ 10% of the amount you did not report on your return for 
the tax year 
■ 50% of the difference between the understated tax 
payable (and certain overstated refundable tax credits) 
related to the amount you did not report and the amount 
of tax withheld related to the amount you did not report

False statements or omissions 
The CRA will charge a penalty if a corporation, either 
knowingly or under circumstances of gross negligence, 
makes a false statement or omission on a return. The 
penalty is the greater of either $100 or 50% of the amount of 
understated tax. 
Reference 
Subsection 163(2) 
Note 
If a corporation is charged a penalty for making a false 
statement or omission under subsection 163(2), the 
corporation cannot be charged a penalty on the same 
amount for failing to report income under 
subsection 163(1). 
Misrepresentation in tax matters by a 
third party 
The CRA will charge a penalty if a person advises or helps 
another person to file a false return or knowingly allows a 
taxpayer to submit false tax information.

Avoidance of tax debts 
Under proposed changes, a new supplementary rule will be 
introduced to strengthen the existing tax debt 
anti-avoidance rule. Under the supplementary rule, where 
certain conditions are met, the property transferred by the 
tax debtor would be deemed to have been transferred to the 
transferee for the purposes of the tax debt avoidance rule. 
This would ensure that the tax debt avoidance rule applies

in situations where property has been transferred from a 
tax debtor to a person and, as part of the same transaction 
or series, property has been received by a non-arm’s length 
person. 
Additionally, under proposed changes, taxpayers who 
participate in tax debt avoidance planning would be jointly 
and severally, or solidarily, liable for the full amount of the 
avoided tax debt. That amount would include any portion 
the planner has effectively retained. This would apply to 
transactions or series of transactions that occur after 
April 15, 2024. 
The existing penalty for those who engage in, participate in, 
assent to, or acquiesce in planning activity that they know, 
or would reasonably be expected to know, is tax debt 
avoidance planning would be extended to apply to tax debt 
avoidance planning that is subject to this supplementary 
rule. The penalty is equal to the lesser of: 
■ 50% of the tax that is attempted to be avoided 
■ $100,000 plus any amount the person, or a related person, 
is entitled to receive or obtain regarding the planning 
activity

Cancel or waive penalties and interest 
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) administers 
legislation, commonly called the taxpayer relief provisions, 
that gives the CRA discretion to cancel or waive penalties 
and interest when taxpayers cannot meet their tax 
obligations due to circumstances beyond their control. 
The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period 
that ended within 10 calendar years before the year in 
which a relief request is made. 
For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it 
relates to a tax year or fiscal period ending in any of the 
10 calendar years before the year in which you make your 
request. For example, your request made in 2024 must 
relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending 
in 2014 or later. 
For interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal 
period, the CRA will consider only the amounts that 
accrued during the 10 calendar years before the year in 
which you make your request. For example, your request 
made in 2024 must relate to interest that accrued in 2014 or 
later. 
Taxpayer relief requests can be made online using the 
CRA’s My Account, My Business Account (MyBA) or

IC07-1R, Taxpayer Relief Provisions 
Voluntary Disclosures Program 
The Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) gives you a 
second chance to correct a tax return you previously filed 
or to file a return that you should have filed. This has to be 
done before the CRA starts any enforcement action or 
investigation against you. 
Applications are processed under one of the two programs: 
the limited program and the general program. 
The limited program limits the level of relief for 
corporations who intentionally avoided their tax 
obligations. Under this program, corporations will not be

referred for criminal prosecution or charged gross 
negligence penalties. However, they will be charged other 
penalties and interest as applicable. 
The general program provides relief to corporations that 
want to correct unintentional errors. Under this program 
corporations will not be charged penalties and will not be 
referred for criminal prosecution related to the information 
being disclosed. The CRA will provide partial interest relief 
for the years preceding the three most recent years of 
returns required to be filed. 
For more details on the VDP, get the most recent version of 
Information Circular IC00-1, Voluntary Disclosures Program, 
or go to canada.ca/taxes-voluntary-disclosures. 
If you want, you can discuss your situation first on a 
no-name or hypothetical basis. To speak with a CRA 
official, contact General Enquiries at 1-800-959-5525. For 
complex technical reporting issues or questions, you will be 
referred to a CRA official in a specialized area. This 
pre-disclosure discussion does not constitute acceptance 
into the VDP anymore. 
The process of making disclosures on a no-name basis has 
ended. 
Information reporting of tax avoidance 
transactions 
Taxpayers, advisors, and promoters who engage in or who 
are entitled to certain fees in relation to certain tax 
avoidance transactions are subject to reporting 
requirements. 
Note 
Under provincial legislation, Ontario and British 
Columbia corporations must meet the same 
requirements. 
Several new measures affecting the mandatory disclosure 
rules apply after June 21, 2023. 
The definition of avoidance transaction is amended so that 
a transaction is considered an avoidance transaction if it can 
reasonably be concluded that one of the main purposes of 
entering into the transaction is to get a tax benefit. 
The following changes apply to the mandatory disclosure 
rules: 
■ changes to existing reportable transaction rules 
■ a new requirement to report notifiable transactions 
■ a new requirement to report reportable uncertain tax 
treatments 
■ related penalties and an extension of the normal 
assessment period in certain circumstances, in the case of 
a failure to report 
Reportable transactions 
Effective for transactions entered into after June 21, 2023, a 
transaction is reportable if it is an avoidance transaction as 
defined in subsection 237.3(1) (previously 245(3)) of the 
federal Act and has one (previously two) of the following 
three generic hallmarks: 
■ the advisor or promoter (including any non arm’s length 
parties) has or had an entitlement to certain types of fees 
■ the advisor or promoter (including any non arm’s length 
parties) has or had confidential protection in respect of a 
tax treatment related to the avoidance transaction 
■ the taxpayer, advisor, or promoter (including any non-
arm’s length parties) has or had contractual protection 
for the transaction (other than as a result of certain types 
of fees or, for transactions entered into after 2022, 
because it concerns contractual protection offered in the 
context of normal commercial transactions to a wide 
market) 
A reportable transaction does not include a transaction that 
is, or is part of, a series of transactions that includes the 
acquisition of a tax shelter or issuance of a flow-through 
share for which an information return has been filed with 
the minister of National Revenue under subsection 237.1(7) 
or 66(12.68), respectively. This is the case unless it is 
reasonable to conclude that one of the main reasons for the 
acquisition of a tax shelter, or the issuance of a 
flow-through share, was to avoid the reportable 
transactions provisions under subsection 237.3. 
For more information on examples of activities that would 
not meet a hallmark and therefore not have to meet a 
reporting obligation, go to canada.ca/mandatory 
-disclosure-rules#toc6. 
Notifiable transactions and reportable 
uncertain tax treatments 
New requirements have been enacted: 
■ to report notifiable transactions. The minister of 
National Revenue has the authority to designate, with 
the agreement of the minister of Finance, a transaction or 
a series of transactions as a notifiable transaction. 
Reporting requirements (and exception to the rule) 
similar to those for reportable transactions apply with the 
inclusion of a prescribed form. A notifiable transaction is 
a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar 
to, a designated transaction, or a transaction in a series of 
transactions that is the same as, or substantially similar 
to, a designated series of transactions. This applies to 
notifiable transactions entered into after June 21, 2023. 
For a list of notifiable transactions designated by the 
minister of National Revenue, go to canada.ca 
/notifiable-transactions. You can subscribe to CRA’s 
electronic mailing list at canada.ca/cra-email-lists to 
receive an email when new notifiable transactions are 
designated by the minister 
■ for a specified corporation to report reportable uncertain 
tax treatments (as reflected in relevant financial 
statements) with the T2 return for the tax year, where 
certain conditions are met, including having at least 
$50 million in assets at the end of the financial year that 
coincides with the tax year. A reportable uncertain tax 
treatment is a tax treatment that a corporation uses or 
plans to use in its income tax filings (including, for 
greater certainty, the decision not to include a particular 
amount in a return of income) and for which there is 
uncertainty over whether the tax treatment will be 
accepted as being in accordance with tax law. This 
applies to tax years that begin after 2022, but the penalty

under subsection 237.5(5) does not apply to tax years that 
begin before June 22, 2023 
Filing requirements 
Form RC312 
For reportable transactions and notifiable transactions 
entered into after June 21, 2023, you must file Form RC312, 
Reportable Transaction and Notifiable Transaction Information 
Return, within 90 days of the earlier of the day the 
corporation, or a person transacting for it: 
■ becomes contractually obligated to enter into the 
reportable or notifiable transaction 
■ enters into the reportable or notifiable transaction 
The previous version of Form RC312, Reportable Transaction 
Information Return, had to be filed on or before June 30 of 
the calendar year following the calendar year in which the 
transaction first became a reportable transaction for the 
person. That version of the form applies to transactions 
entered into before June 22, 2023. 
For more information, go to canada.ca/mandatory 
-disclosure-rules. 
Form RC3133 
For tax years that start after 2022, if you have one or more 
reportable uncertain tax treatments for a tax year, you must 
file Form RC3133, Reportable Uncertain Tax Treatments 
Information Return, for each reportable uncertain tax 
treatment, on or before the corporation’s tax return filing-
due date for the year. 
Reassessment 
If the information return is not filed as required, the 
reassessment period is extended by three years (if the 
corporation is a CCPC) or four years (if the corporation is 
not a CCPC) after the day on which the information return 
is filed as required. The scope of an assessment, 
reassessment, or additional assessment during the extended 
reassessment period for a taxpayer’s tax year is limited to 
the extent that it can reasonably be regarded as relating to 
the reportable transaction, notifiable transaction, or 
reportable uncertain tax treatment. 
If a corporation has a reporting requirement for a 
transaction relevant to the corporation’s income tax return 
for a tax year, the normal reassessment period will not start 
for the transaction until the corporation has complied with 
the reporting requirement. As a result, if a corporation does 
not comply with a mandatory disclosure reporting 
requirement for a tax year for a transaction, a reassessment 
of the year will not become statute-barred for the 
transaction only. 
Penalties 
Since there are specific penalty provisions under the 
mandatory disclosure rules (MDR) that apply to reportable 
or notifiable transactions, the general penalty provision for 
failure to file an information return is removed for these 
transactions. This is deemed to have come into force on 
June 22, 2023, which is the coming into force date of the 
specific penalty provisions under the MDR. 
Failure to report could result in suspension of the tax 
benefit, a penalty for failure to report, or both. 
For transactions entered into after June 21, 2023, penalties 
will apply for each failure to report a reportable transaction 
or a notifiable transaction: 
■ to persons who enter into such transactions, or for whom 
a tax benefit results from such transactions. The penalty 
is equal to: 
– $500 per week for each failure to report the transaction, 
up to the greater of $25,000 and 25% of the tax benefit 
– for a corporation with assets having a total carrying 
value of $50 million or more for its last tax year that 
ends before the day on which the information return is 
required to be filed, $2,000 per week for each failure to 
report the transaction, up to the greater of $100,000 and 
25% of the tax benefit 
■ to advisors and promoters of such transactions and 
persons who do not deal at arm’s length with them and 
who are entitled to a fee for the transactions. The penalty 
is equal to the total of: 
– the amount of the fees charged by that person for the 
transaction 
– $10,000 
– $1,000 per day that the person fails to report the 
transaction, up to a maximum of $100,000 
In addition, a penalty will apply for each failure to report 
an uncertain tax treatment. The penalty is equal to $ 2,000 
for each week (or each part of a week) during which the 
failure continues, up to a maximum of $100,000. This 
penalty applies to tax years starting after June 21, 2023.

Country-by-country reporting 
Country-by-country reporting applies to multinational 
enterprise groups that have a total consolidated group 
revenue of €750 million or more, as reflected in their 
consolidated financial statements in the immediately 
preceding fiscal year. 
If the ultimate parent entity or surrogate parent entity of 
such a multinational enterprise group is resident in 
Canada, it has to file Form RC4649, Country-by-Country 
Report, with the CRA. This has to be done no later than 
12 months after the end of the reporting fiscal year. 
Beginning on October 1, 2021, Canadian corporations 
required to file Form RC4649 must do so electronically 
using EFILE or Web Access Code (WAC), available through 
CRA-T2-certified software that supports the preparation of 
Country-by-Country reports. This includes all filings by 
Canadian corporations as the ultimate parent entity or

surrogate parent entity, and most filings by a constituent 
entity under the secondary reporting requirement. Failure 
to file electronically may result in the application of 
penalties.

When the CRA can reassess 
your return 
Within certain time limits, the CRA can reassess your 
return or make additional assessments of tax, interest, and 
penalties. These time limits vary, depending on the type of 
corporation and the nature of the reassessment. 
Normal reassessment period 
The CRA can usually reassess a return for a tax year: 
■ within three years of the date it sent the original notice of 
assessment for the tax year, if the corporation was a 
CCPC at the end of the year 
■ within four years of the date it sent the original notice of 
assessment for the tax year, if the corporation was not a 
CCPC at the end of the year 
Extended reassessment period 
The normal reassessment period can be extended for an 
extra three years for several reasons, including any of the 
following: 
■ to carry back a loss or credit from a later tax year 
■ when a non-arm’s length transaction (transaction as 
defined in subsection 247(1)) involving the corporation 
and a non-resident affects the corporation’s tax 
■ if the corporation pays an amount or receives a refund of 
foreign income or profits tax 
■ when a reassessment of another taxpayer’s tax for any of 
the above reasons affects the corporation’s tax 
■ if the reassessment results from a non-resident 
corporation’s allocation of revenue or expenses to its 
Canadian business or from a notional transaction, such as 
“branch advance”, between the non-resident corporation 
and its Canadian business 
■ to give effect to the application of the non-resident trust 
rules in section 94 or to the application of the foreign 
investment rules under sections 94.1 and 94.2 
■ if the income is related to a foreign affiliate of the 
corporation (for tax years of the corporation starting after 
February 26, 2018) 
■ the reassessment is to carry back losses or certain tax 
credits and deductions where a prescribed form 
requesting the amendment has been filed on time 
Non-resident non-arm’s length person (extra six years) 
For losses incurred in a particular tax year, the 
reassessment period for a preceding tax year to which those 
losses are carried back is extended six years beyond the 
normal reassessment period if both of the following apply: 
■ the losses are reduced as a result of a reassessment made 
to the particular tax year beyond the normal 
reassessment period for the year 
■ the reassessment to the particular tax year is made as a 
consequence of a transaction involving the corporation 
and a non-arm’s length non-resident person 
Provincial income reallocation (extra one year) 
If the reassessment results from a provincial income 
reallocation, the normal reassessment period can be 
extended for one year from the later of: 
■ the day on which the CRA is advised of the provincial 
reassessment

was mailed 
Substantive CCPCs – Deferring tax using foreign 
entities (extra one year) 
The reassessment period for substantive CCPCs is extended 
one year beyond the normal reassessment period for any 
resulting assessment of Part IV tax because of a corporation 
being assessed or reassessed a dividend refund. This 
measure generally applies to tax years that end after 
April 6, 2022, with some exceptions. 
Requirements for information and compliance orders 
Under proposed changes, effective on royal assent, the 
existing information gathering provisions would be 
amended by: 
■ creating a new notice of non-compliance 
■ providing the possibility to require that any required 
information or document be provided under oath or 
affirmation 
■ adding a penalty when the CRA issues a compliance 
order or a notice of non-compliance 
■ expanding the rules to stop the reassessment limitation 
clock 
If the CRA issues a new notice of non-compliance to a 
corporation that has not complied with a notice or 
requirement to provide information or assistance, the 
penalty would be equal to $50 for each day the notice of 
non-compliance is outstanding, up to a maximum of 
$25,000. 
If the CRA obtains a compliance order from a court to order 
a non-compliant taxpayer to comply with a CRA 
information request, the new penalty would be equal to 
10% of the aggregate tax payable for the tax years the 
compliance order relates to, if the tax payable in each 
relevant tax year is equal or more than $50,000. 
When a corporation contests a requirement for information 
or an application for a compliance order in court, a 
“stop-the-clock” rule applies. This rule extends the 
corporation’s reassessment period by the period of time 
during which the requirement for information or 
compliance order is contested. The period generally starts 
when the corporation makes its first court filing to contest 
the requirement for information or compliance order and 
ends on the final disposition of the application (including 
any appeals). 
The “stop-the-clock” rules do not currently apply to all 
situations when a corporation does not comply with a 
requirement or notice to provide information that the CRA 
issued. Under proposed changes, effective on royal assent, 
these rules would be amended so that they apply: 
■ when a corporation seeks a judicial review of any 
requirement or notice to provide information issued to 
the corporation or to a person that does not deal at arm’s 
length with the corporation in relation to the audit and 
enforcement process 
■ during any period a notice of non-compliance is 
outstanding 
Note 
The CRA can send requirements for information, 
including those for foreign-based information, to banks 
and credit unions electronically, rather than delivering 
them in person or by registered or certified mail. Written 
consent of the bank or credit union is required before 
requirements can be sent electronically. 
Unlimited reassessment period 
The CRA can reassess a return at any time, including when: 
■ the corporation has made a misrepresentation because of 
neglect, carelessness, wilful default, or fraud in either 
filing the return or supplying information required by 
the Act 
■ the corporation filed Form T2029, Waiver in Respect of the 
Normal Reassessment Period or Extended Reassessment 
Period, with a tax services office before the normal 
reassessment period expires. Form T2029 can be filed up 
to three more years after the end of the normal 
reassessment period if the waiver applies to one of the 
situations previously described under “Extended 
reassessment period” 
Note 
If you want to revoke a waiver that was previously filed 
to extend the normal reassessment period for a certain 
tax year, file Form T652, Notice of Revocation of Waiver, at 
your tax services office. The revocation will take effect 
six months after you file Form T652. 
Sale or disposition of real estate 
 The CRA may at any time make an assessment, 
reassessment, or additional assessment of an income tax 
return beyond the normal reassessment period for any of 
the following reasons: 
■ the corporation does not report in its initial income tax 
return a sale or other disposition of a real or immovable 
property that is capital property of the corporation 
■ the partnership of which the corporation is a member did 
not report the sale or other disposition in the initial 
partnership information return 
If the corporation later amends its return to report the 
disposition of the property (for example by filing a request 
for adjustments under subsection 245(6)), the CRA may still 
make a reassessment outside of the normal reassessment 
period within three years of the amendment being filed. 
Under this extended reassessment period, the reassessment 
is limited to amounts reasonably relating to the unreported 
or previously unreported disposition of real or immovable 
property that is capital property of the corporation or 
partnership, as the case may be.

How to request a reassessment 
You can request a reassessment electronically using the 
latest commercial tax preparation software packages, or 
send a letter to the tax centre that serves the corporation. If 
you send a letter, state the name of the corporation, the

22
business number, the tax year, and any details that apply. 
With your letter, include any relevant supporting 
information, such as revised financial statements or the 
General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) and 
schedules. If you are preparing your return using tax 
preparation software, submit the bar codes that contain the 
information needed to reassess your return. Do not send 
the entire T2 return. 
To ask to carry back a loss or tax credit to a prior tax year, 
file whichever of the following schedules apply: 
■ Schedule 4, Corporation Loss Continuity and Application, 
to ask to carry back a loss 
■ Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign 
Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to ask 
to carry back foreign tax credits on business income 
■ Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, to ask 
to carry back an investment tax credit 
■ Schedule 42, Calculation of Unused Part I Tax Credit, to ask 
to carry back a Part I tax credit 
You can file these schedules with the return on which you 
report the loss or earn the credit, or you can forward them 
separately to the tax centre that serves the corporation.

Subsection 152(6) 
How to file a formal dispute 
Many misunderstandings are caused by a lack of 
information or by a simple miscommunication. That’s why 
the CRA says: “Talk to us.” 
If you have new or additional information, you or your 
authorized representative can ask for a change online at 
My Business Account, Represent a Client, or by writing to 
the CRA. Many disputes are resolved this way. 
If you disagree with an assessment or a determination, you 
can make a formal objection. 
Filing an objection is the first step in the formal process of 
resolving your dispute. You have 90 days after the date of 
the notice of assessment or determination to file an 
objection. 
You can file an objection: 
■ online in My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra 
-business-account, or in Represent a Client at 
canada.ca/taxes-representatives, by selecting “File a 
formal dispute (Notice of Objection)” under 
“Corporation Income Tax” 
■ by mail, using Form T400A, Notice of Objection – Income 
Tax Act, or writing to the chief of appeals at your 
Appeals Intake Centre (see appendix B of Guide P148) 
In all cases, you have to explain why you disagree and 
include all relevant facts and supporting documents. 
For large corporations, your objection must: 
■ reasonably describe each issue 
■ specify for each issue the relief you are seeking, 
expressed as the amount of a change in the income, 
taxable income, loss, taxes payable, refundable amounts, 
and overpayments or balance of unclaimed outlays, 
expenses, or other amounts of the corporation 
■ provide facts and reasons the corporation relied on for 
each issue 
Reference 
Section 165 
A large corporation that objects to an assessment will have 
to pay 50% of the disputed amount. A corporation is a large 
corporation if the total taxable capital employed in Canada 
at the end of the tax year by the corporation and its related 
corporations is over $10 million. The corporation also has to 
pay the full amount of taxes not in dispute. 
Reference 
Subsection 225.1(7) 
For more information about objections and appeals, see 
Guide P148, Resolving your dispute: Objection rights under the 
Income Tax Act, or go to canada.ca/cra-file-objection. 
Disputing loss determinations 
The formal process of resolving a dispute does not usually 
apply to loss amounts under dispute, because there is no 
tax, interest, or penalty involved. 
However, a corporation may request a loss determination if 
it does not agree with the amount of the losses assessed by 
the CRA. The CRA will determine the amount of the loss 
and confirm in writing by issuing Form T67AM, Notice of 
Determination/Redetermination of a Loss. 
Once the corporation has received the notice of 
determination, it can file an objection within 90 days after 
the date of the notice. 
Note 
You cannot request a loss determination if the CRA 
assessed your loss to be the same as what you reported. 
If the corporation asks, the CRA will make determinations 
of the following amounts: 
■ a non-capital loss 
■ a net capital loss 
■ a restricted farm loss 
■ a farm loss 
■ a limited partnership loss 
Send any requests for loss determinations to your tax 
services office or tax centre.

Keeping records 
Keep your paper and electronic records for six years from 
the end of the last tax year that they relate to. If you file 
your income tax return late, keep your records for six years 
from the date you file your return. 
Certain records must be kept longer. These include minute 
books, which have to be kept until sometime after 
dissolution. However, if you want to destroy your records 
early, complete Form T137, Request for Destruction of 
Records. For more information, go to canada.ca/taxes 
-records.

Signing up for email notifications when filing 
your T2 return 
Corporations that use tax preparation software can register 
for email notifications by sending the CRA their email 
address and agreeing to electronic delivery of 
correspondence when they file their return. Once the CRA 
has processed your return, it will send you a registration 
email notification to the email address you gave, 
confirming your registration. 
If you register for email notifications for your T2 account, 
the CRA will send you an email when notices, letters, or 
statements are available for viewing in 
My Business Account (separate registration is required) and 
when other important changes are made on your account. 
To register for My Business Account, go to canada.ca/my 
-cra-business-account. 
If you signup for email notifications, the CRA will not 
send these documents to you through Canada Post. 
The default method of correspondence for businesses that 
use My Business Account became electronic, effective on 
June 22, 2023. However, with a 30-day notice, businesses 
may still choose to also receive paper correspondence. 
If you don’t want to receive email notifications anymore, 
log into My Business Account and select “Notification 
preferences” to remove your email address.

Box 1 – Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) 
The corporation is a CCPC if it meets all of the following 
requirements at the end of the tax year: 
■ it is a private corporation 
■ it is a corporation that was resident in Canada and was 
either incorporated in Canada or resident in Canada 
from June 18, 1971, to the end of the tax year

that lists its shares on a designated stock exchange 
outside of Canada 
■ it is not controlled directly or indirectly by any 
combination of persons described in the three previous 
conditions 
■ if all of its shares that are owned by a non-resident 
person, by a public corporation (other than a prescribed 
venture capital corporation), or by a corporation with a 
class of shares listed on a designated stock exchange 
were owned by one person, that person would not own 
sufficient shares to control the corporation 
■ no class of its shares of capital stock is listed on a 
designated stock exchange 
Note 
A CCPC that has elected under subsection 89(11) not to 
be a CCPC for certain purposes should tick box 1 when 
filling line 040.

Box 4 – Corporation controlled by a public corporation 
The corporation is a corporation controlled by a public 
corporation if it is a Canadian subsidiary of a public 
corporation. This type of corporation does not qualify as a 
public corporation for determining the type of corporation. 
Box 5 – Other corporation 
The corporation is an other corporation if it does not fall 
within the other categories. Examples of other corporations 
include general insurers and Crown corporations. 
Note 
Credit unions or cooperative corporations should tick 
box 1 at line 040 if they meet the definition of a 
Canadian-controlled private corporation under 
subsection 125(7) (without reference to 
subsections 137(7) or 136(1) respectively). 
Line 043 – If the type of corporation changed during the 
tax year, provide the effective date of the change 
Indicate the effective date of the change. Do not include 
other types of changes in this section, such as the change 
from active to inactive status. 
A change of corporation type may bring significant tax 
consequences. For example, certain calculations on the 
return depend on whether the corporation was a private 
corporation or a CCPC throughout the tax year, at any time 
in the tax year, or at the end of the tax year. 
Note 
If the corporation changed from, or to, a CCPC, see 
Line 066. Do not complete line 043 if you answer yes at 
line 066 and you are filing a tax return with a deemed 
tax year-end because of subsection 249(3.1). 
Lines 060, 061, 063, 065 – To which tax year 
does this return apply? 
Specify hours and minutes 
When using Corporation Internet Filing, you can now 
specify hours and minutes in the tax year-end (TYE) at 
line 061 when the TYE has changed for any of the following 
reasons (you answered yes at the line number in brackets): 
■ acquisition of control under subsection 249(4) when 
electing not to apply subsection 256(9) (line 063) 
■ change to the TYE when changing from a Canadian-
controlled private corporation to another type of 
corporation under subsection 249(3.1) (line 066) 
■ first year after amalgamation (line 071) 
■ final year before amalgamation (line 076) 
Note 
You can also specify hours and minutes in the tax year 
start (TYS) at line 060 when the TYE in the prior year 
had specified hours and minutes (you answered yes at 
any of the above line numbers in brackets in the 
current TYE or answered yes at line 063 or 066 in the 
prior TYE). 
You can also specify hours and minutes in the date entered 
at line 065, which is the date of the acquisition of control 
resulting in the application of subsection 249(4). 
Time is to be reported by the 24-hour clock. You do not 
need to specify the hours and minutes if the time of 
the TYS is 00:00 or the TYE is 23:59 (11:59 pm). For CRA 
purposes, the beginning of a day is 00:00 and the end of a 
day is 23:59. 
Hours and minutes should only be entered when the event 
results in the corporation (or successor) starting a tax year 
on the same day the previous tax year ends. In the 
following example, see how to report hours and minutes 
for a multiple amalgamation on the same day. 
Example 
Two predecessor corporations amalgamate (yes at line 076) 
on January 15, 2024, at 09:44. Both have a TYS of 
January 1, 2024. 
Both predecessors will report: 
■ line 060 (TYS) as 2024-01-01 00:00 
■ line 061 (TYE) as 2024-01-15 09:43 
The new corporation (yes at line 071) is also a final to 
amalgamation (yes at line 076) on January 15, 2024, with its 
final to amalgamation taking place at 17:27. 
The new/predecessor corporation will report: 
■ line 060 (TYS) as 2024-01-15 09:44 
■ line 061 (TYE) as 2024-01-15 17:26 
 
Lines 060 and 061 – Tax year start and tax year-end 
The corporation’s tax year is its fiscal period. A fiscal period 
cannot be longer than 53 weeks (371 days). 
In the spaces provided, enter the first and last days of the 
tax year. If the particular time of day applies, enter the 
hours and minutes to specify the time. The first day of this 
tax year has to be the day after the last day of the previous 
tax year. You have to file a return for every calendar year. 
A new corporation may choose any tax year-end as long as 
its first tax year does not exceed 53 weeks from the date it 
was either incorporated or formed as a result of an 
amalgamation. 
Make sure the financial statements or the General Index of 
Financial Information (GIFI) you attach to the return match 
the tax year of the return. 
Note 
A professional corporation that is a member of a 
partnership and that carries on business in Canada 
has to have a December 31 year-end. 
Generally, unless you have received approval to change the 
fiscal period, the corporation’s fiscal period is the same 
from year to year. To change a fiscal period, write a letter to 
your tax services office asking for approval and include 
details to explain the reasons for the change as well as its 
effective date. If you do not include these details, the 
processing of your request may be delayed.

In some situations, you do not need approval to change the 
fiscal period. These situations include any of the following: 
■ the corporation has wound-up and you are filing its final 
return with an abbreviated fiscal period 
■ the corporation has to end its tax year at a certain time 
because it is emigrating to another country, becoming 
exempt from tax, or ceasing to be exempt from tax 
■ a person or group of persons acquired control of the 
corporation under subsection 249(4) 
■ the corporation becomes or ceases to be a Canadian-
controlled private corporation 
Note 
A corporation that becomes bankrupt must get CRA’s 
approval to change its fiscal period.

Lines 063 and 065 – Has there been an acquisition of 
control resulting in the application of subsection 249(4) 
since the tax year start on line 060? 
If you answer yes, enter on line 065 the date the control 
was acquired. 
There is an acquisition of control when, during the tax year, 
a person or group of persons acquired control of the 
corporation. 
When control is acquired, subsection 249(4) provides that 
the tax year of the corporation ends immediately before 
that control is acquired. You do not need approval for the 
changed tax year. 
File a return for the tax year that ends immediately before 
control is acquired. The next tax year starts at the time 
control is acquired, and the corporation can choose any tax 
year-end within the next 53 weeks. 
If control is acquired up to seven days after the end of an 
established tax year, generally a corporation can choose to 
extend the tax year up to the time control is acquired. In 
this case, attach a letter to your return that says you are 
making an election under paragraph 249(4)(b). 
Where shares of a corporation are transferred to an estate 
because of a death, there is no acquisition of control. In 
general, this also applies when the transfer is made to a 
related person. As a result, there is no deemed tax year-end 
and no tax return is required to be filed. For more 
information, see subsection 256(7). 
Notes 
The acquisition of control under subsection 256(9) of a 
corporation is usually deemed to occur at the beginning 
of the day on which the acquisition takes place. 
However, the particular time of day that the acquisition 
of control took place will be recognized if the 
corporation makes an election under subsection 256(9). 
To elect under subsection 256(9), include a note with 
your return for the tax year ending immediately before 
control was acquired and enter the hours and minutes 
that specify the time of day at line 065. 
The deeming rule does not apply when determining the 
status of a corporation as a small business corporation or 
a Canadian-controlled private corporation at the time of 
the transaction that caused the change of control. The 
status of the corporation will not change until the actual 
time of the acquisition. 
Line 066 – Is the date on line 061 a 
deemed tax year-end according to 
subsection 249(3.1)? 
If at any time a corporation becomes or stops being a 
Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) for any 
reason other than an acquisition of control, 
subsection 249(3.1) provides that the tax year of the 
corporation is deemed to end immediately before that 
change. You do not need the minister’s approval for the 
changed tax year. 
File a return for the tax year that ends immediately before 
the change. The next tax year is deemed to start on the date 
that the corporation type changed, and the corporation can 
choose any tax year-end within the next 53 weeks. 
If the change occurs up to seven days after the end of an 
established tax year and there has not been an acquisition 
of control and the corporation has not become or stopped 
being a CCPC, within those seven days the corporation can 
choose to extend the tax year up to the time the change 
occurred. In this case, attach a letter to your return that says 
you are making an election under paragraph 249(3.1)(c). 
Line 067 – Is the corporation a professional 
corporation that is a member of a 
partnership? 
A professional corporation is a corporation that carries on 
the professional practice of an accountant, dentist, lawyer, 
(including a notary in the province of Quebec), medical 
doctor, veterinarian, or chiropractor. 
Billed-basis accounting for professional corporations 
For tax years that begin after March 21, 2017, professional 
corporations are not allowed to use billed-basis accounting 
anymore. That is, they are no longer permitted to elect to 
exclude the value of work in progress at the end of a tax 
year from business income for that year. 
As a transitional measure, where a corporation has elected 
to use billed-basis accounting for its last tax year that 
begins before March 22, 2017, the inclusion of work in 
progress is phased into income as follows: 
■ for the first tax year of the corporation that begins after 
March 21, 2017, 20% of the lesser of the cost and the fair 
market value of work in progress will be taken into 
account for determining the value of inventory held by 
the business under the ITA 
■ this rate will increase progressively to reach 100% at the 
end of the fifth tax year that begins after March 21, 2017 
Line 070 – Is this the first year of filing after 
incorporation?

Filer After Incorporation, Amalgamation, or Winding-up of a

Subsidiary into a Parent, with your return. If you do not file 
Schedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed. 
See chapters 2 and 3 for other schedules you may have to 
attach to your return. 
Note 
The tax year of a new corporation cannot be longer than 
53 weeks from the date it was incorporated. 
If this is your first year of filing after incorporation, you 
must tick yes at line 030 and complete lines 031 to 038. 
Line 071 – Is this the first year of filing after 
amalgamation? 
If you answer yes, you have to file Schedule 24, First-Time 
Filer After Incorporation, Amalgamation, or Winding-up of a 
Subsidiary into a Parent, with your return. If you do not file 
Schedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed. 
Note 
The tax year of a new corporation cannot be longer than 
53 weeks from the date it was amalgamated. 
If this is your first year of filing after amalgamation, you 
must tick yes at line 030 and complete lines 031 to 038. 
Line 072 – Has there been a wind-up of a 
subsidiary under section 88 during the 
current tax year? 
If you answer yes, you have to file Schedule 24, First-Time 
Filer After Incorporation, Amalgamation, or Winding-up of a 
Subsidiary into a Parent, with your return. If you do not file 
Schedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed. 
Reference 
IT-126, Meaning of “Winding up” 
Line 076 – Is this the final tax year before 
amalgamation? 
Predecessor corporations filing their last returns have to 
answer yes to this question on their final returns. 
When two or more corporations amalgamate, each of the 
predecessor corporations has to file a return for the period 
ending immediately before the effective date of 
amalgamation. The effective date of amalgamation is 
governed by corporate law. Generally, the effective date is 
on the certificate of amalgamation or the letters patent of 
amalgamation. 
Note 
The CRA cannot accept returns filed for the period 
ending just before a date that is not the effective date of 
amalgamation. 
Reference 
S4–F7–C1, Amalgamations of Canadian Corporations 
Line 078 – Is this the final return up to 
dissolution? 
You have to answer yes if you have already permanently 
dissolved your corporation with the incorporating 
authority and you are filing your final return for a tax year 
ending on the date of dissolution. You will find the date of 
dissolution on the articles of dissolution. 
The responsible representative has to get a clearance 
certificate from the tax services office before distributing 
any of the corporation’s property under his or her control. 
By getting the certificate, the responsible representative will 
avoid being personally liable for the unpaid taxes, interest, 
and penalties. Include Schedule 100, Balance Sheet 
Information, with the final return, which shows how the 
assets were distributed. 
Note 
If you want to dissolve your corporation, you should 
send an application for dissolution to the government 
body that governs the affairs of your corporation. 
Once the corporation has been dissolved, you should 
consult Form RC145, Request to Close Business Number 
Program Accounts, to determine whether you need to 
complete that form and send the CRA the articles of 
dissolution. Otherwise, the CRA considers that the 
corporation still exists, and it will have to file a return even 
if there is no tax payable. 
Once the corporation is dissolved, any refunds to which the 
corporation would be entitled revert to the Crown and 
cannot normally be issued to the corporation or its 
representatives unless the charter is reinstated. 
If the corporation was not involuntarily dissolved and the 
charter is not reinstated, a refund can be issued if all returns 
have been filed up to the date of dissolution for all revenue 
lines (T2, GST, and other levies returns) and the refund is 
issued to one of the following: 
■ the sole shareholder of the corporation 
■ a legal representative of the corporation when there are 
multiple shareholders 
If these conditions are not met, the refund will remain with 
the Crown.

Schedules can be organized into two categories: 
■ information schedules, including general information 
schedules and those relating to transactions with 
non-residents 
■ calculation schedules, including schedules used to 
calculate net income, taxable income, deductions, taxes, 
and credits 
You will find a complete list of the schedules at the end of 
this guide. The schedules are available at canada.ca/cra 
-forms-publications. You can also get them by calling 
1-800-959-5525. To file the schedules the CRA does not 
publish, such as Schedule 92, gather the requested 
information and label it with the schedule number in the 
top right-hand corner of each page. 
On pages 2 and 3 of the return, you will find a list of the 
most common schedules you may have to attach to your 
return. If you respond yes to any of the questions on these 
pages, attach to your T2 return the schedule that applies, 
unless otherwise instructed. 
Financial statements or General Index of 
Financial Information (GIFI) 
Each corporation should include complete financial 
statement information for the tax year of the return using 
the General Index of Financial Information. 
You do NOT have to file paper financial statements or 
notes to financial statements if you file that year’s T2 return 
electronically. 
Note 
Certain non-resident corporations do not have to file 
using GIFI. For more information, see Guide RC4088, 
General Index of Financial Information (GIFI). 
GIFI schedules include: 
■ Schedule 100, Balance Sheet Information 
■ Schedule 125, Income Statement Information, and, if 
necessary, Schedule 140, Summary Income Statement (You 
will find Schedule 140 at the end of Schedule 125.) 
■ Schedule 141, General Index of Financial 
Information (GIFI) – Additional Information. Schedule 141 is 
a set of questions designed to determine who prepared 
the financial statements and the extent of their 
involvement, and to identify the type of information 
contained in the notes to the financial statements 
Include any notes to the financial statements and the 
auditor or accountant’s report, if they were prepared. You 
should include this information even if you are filing your 
return using tax preparation software. You can include any 
notes to the financial statements and auditor or 
accountant’s report on the GIFI when transmitting your 
return electronically. For more information, see “Using tax 
preparation software” on page 11. 
When preparing the first return for a new corporation, 
attach all of the following documents: 
■ Schedule 101, Opening Balance Sheet Information 
■ copies of all relevant agreements or the full details on 
shares issued for anything other than cash consideration, 
if they apply



=== 第 32 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
32
■ if it applies, the closing balance sheet of the 
proprietorship, partnership, or corporation if the new 
corporation acquired the assets or business, or assumed 
the liabilities of a former proprietorship, partnership, or 
corporation 
Corporations that are inactive throughout the tax year and 
that do not have balance sheet or income statement 
information to report do not have to attach schedules 100, 
125, and 141 to their T2 return. However, they will be 
accepted if filed. 
The GIFI schedules are to be completed with information 
from the corporation’s financial statements. These 
schedules are laid out with a “column A” where the 
appropriate GIFI code is entered, and a “column B” where 
the corresponding dollar amount is entered. 
The GIFI is included in all tax preparation software 
packages certified by the CRA and in most accounting 
software. 
For more information on the GIFI, see Guide RC4088, 
General Index of Financial Information (GIFI). 
Information schedules and forms 
The following section describes the various general 
information schedules and forms you may have to 
complete. 
Schedule 9, Related and Associated 
Corporations 
Complete Schedule 9 if the corporation is related to or 
associated with at least one other corporation. 
Reference 
Sections 251 and 256 
When is a corporation associated? 
Association is based on control. Control can be exerted 
either directly or indirectly in any way. A person or a 
group of persons can control a corporation. Keep in mind 
that, in this context, a person can be either an individual or 
a corporation. 
Control includes both de jure control and de facto control. 
De jure control is the right of control that depends on a 
person owning enough shares of a corporation to give that 
person a majority of the voting power. De facto control, or 
factual control, occurs when a corporation is subject to any 
direct or indirect influencing that, if exercised, would result 
in actual control being exerted. 
When determining whether a taxpayer has any direct or 
indirect influence that, if exercised, would result in factual 
control of the corporation, one must: 
■ take into consideration all factors that are relevant in the 
circumstances 
■ not be limited to whether the taxpayer has a legally 
enforceable right or ability to make a change in the board 
of directors of the corporation, or the board’s power, or 
to exercise influence over the shareholder(s) who have 
that right or ability. The previous factors are not 
mandatory in determining factual control 
In general, a corporation is associated with another 
corporation if it meets one of the following six conditions at 
any time in the tax year. Remember that controlled means 
directly or indirectly in any way. 
Condition 1 
The corporations are associated if one corporation controls 
the other. 
Example 
Corp X owns 100% of the voting shares of Corp Y, which in 
turn owns 51% of the voting shares of Corp Z. 
Corp X is associated with Corp Y because it exerts direct 
control over it. 
Corp X is associated with Corp Z because it exerts indirect 
control over it. 
 
Condition 2 
The corporations are associated if both corporations are 
controlled by the same person or group of persons. 
Corporations may be associated because the same group of 
persons controls both corporations, but the members of this 
group do not act together and have no other connection to 
each other. 
CCPCs that are associated only because of this definition of 
a group will NOT be considered associated when: 
■ calculating the refundable investment tax credit on 
qualified SR&ED expenditures 
■ calculating the expenditure limit 
■ allocating the expenditure limit 
For this exception to apply, one of the corporations must 
have at least one shareholder who is not common to both 
corporations. 
The corporations will continue to be associated for all other 
purposes of the Income Tax Act. 
Example 
Bob owns 40% of the voting shares of Corp ABC and 30% of 
the voting shares of Corp XYZ. Ike owns 20% of the voting 
shares of Corp ABC and 40% of the voting shares of 
Corp XYZ. 
As a group, Bob and Ike control both companies. 
Corps ABC and XYZ are associated. 
 
Condition 3 
The corporations are associated if all of the following apply: 
■ each corporation is controlled by one person 
■ that person is related to the person controlling the other 
corporation 
■ one of those persons owns at least 25% of the issued 
shares of any class, other than shares of a specified class, 
of the capital stock of each corporation



=== 第 33 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
33
 
Example 
Billy owns 100% of the issued share capital of Corp AB. He 
also owns 25% of the class A shares (other than shares of a 
specified class) of Corp CD, whose controlling shareholder 
is Billy’s brother. 
Corps AB and CD are associated. 
 
Condition 4 
The corporations are associated if all of the following apply: 
■ one corporation is controlled by one person 
■ that person is related to each member of a group of 
persons who controls the other corporation 
■ that person owns at least 25% of the issued shares of any 
class, other than shares of a specified class, of the capital 
stock of the other corporation 
Example 
Buddy controls Corp AY. His two daughters control 
Corp AZ. Buddy also owns 50% of the class A preferred 
shares of Corp AZ. 
Corps AY and AZ are associated. 
 
Condition 5 
The corporations are associated if all of the following apply: 
■ each corporation is controlled by a related group 
■ each of the members of one of the related groups is 
related to all members of the other related group 
■ one or more persons who are members of both related 
groups, either alone or together, own at least 25% of the 
issued shares of any class, other than shares of a specified 
class, of the capital stock of each corporation 
Example 
Anne and her two daughters control Corp One. Anne and 
her two sons control Corp Two. Anne owns 33% of the 
common shares in each corporation. 
Corps One and Two are associated. 
 
Condition 6 
Under subsection 256(2), two corporations that are not 
associated with each other will be considered associated if 
they are associated with the same corporation (the third 
corporation). Special rules apply for determining the small 
business deduction. See Schedule 28, Election not to be 
Associated Through a Third Corporation, on page 34 for 
details. 
Example 
Corp AB owns 100% of the issued share capital of Corp CD. 
It also owns 25% of the class A shares (other than shares of 
a specified class) of Corp XY, whose controlling 
shareholder is Billy. Billy’s brother controls Corp AB. 
Corps AB, CD, and XY are associated.

Schedule 23, Agreement Among Associated 
Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to 
Allocate the Business Limit 
All CCPCs that are associated have to file Schedule 23. 
This schedule is used to: 
■ identify all the corporations to establish: 
– the date the balance of tax is due (see “Balance-due 
day” on page 14) 
– the calculation of the reduction to the business limit 
■ allocate a percentage of the business limit to each 
associated corporation. The total of all percentages 
cannot be more than 100%. The maximum business limit 
is provided at Line 410 – Business limit, on page 77 
Notes 
Only one of the associated or related corporations needs 
to file Schedule 23 for a calendar year. However, if 
Schedule 23 is not already on file when the CRA assesses 
any of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar 
year of the agreement, it will ask for one. 
If the corporation’s tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, 
prorate the business limit allocated in column 400 of 
Schedule 23 based on the number of days in the tax year 
divided by 365. 
Associated corporations with more than one tax year in 
a calendar year 
Special rules apply to determine the business limit for 
associated corporations that have more than one tax year 
ending in the same calendar year. 
For the second or later tax years that end in the same 
calendar year, the business limit is whichever of the 
following amounts is less: 
■ the amount allocated to the corporation for the first tax 
year 
■ the amount allocated to the corporation for the later tax 
year in question 
Make sure the total of the business limits of all associated 
corporations for any tax years that end in the same calendar 
year is not more than the maximum allowable business 
limit for that calendar year. 
If the corporation’s tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, 
prorate the business limit as determined above, based on 
the number of days in the tax year divided by 365. 
 
Example 
Corp A and Corp B are associated in 2024. 
Corp A’s tax year runs from January 1, 2024, to 
June 30, 2024. 
The business limit allocated to Corp A for its June 30, 2024, 
tax year is $100,000.

On November 1, 2024, Corp C becomes associated with 
Corp A and Corp B. The tax year-end for Corp C is 
December 31, 2024. Corp A and Corp B change their 
year-ends to match Corp C’s year-end. 
The corporations decide to allocate a $300,000 business 
limit to Corp C for the December 31, 2024, year-end. 
Because the total of their business limits cannot be more 
than $500,000, the corporations allocate $90,000 to Corp A 
and $110,000 to Corp B. 
Question 
What is Corp A’s business limit for each of the two tax 
years ending in the 2024 calendar year? 
Answer 
Tax year ending June 30, 2024: 
Because the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, Corp A 
prorates the business limit for the number of days in the tax 
year as follows: 
$100,000  × 181 days  =  $49,589

Note 
365 is not adjusted for a leap year. 
Tax year ending December 31, 2024: 
Because the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, Corp A 
prorates the business limit for the number of days in the tax 
year. Corp A uses the $90,000 business limit allocated in 
this tax year, because it is less than the $100,000 business 
limit allocated in its first tax year ending in 2024. 
Corp A prorates the business limit as follows: 
$90,000  × 184 days  =  $45,370 
 
 
365 days 
Note 
365 is not adjusted for a leap year.

Schedule 49, Agreement Among Associated 
Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to 
Allocate the Expenditure Limit 
All CCPCs that are associated and have scientific research 
and experimental development (SR&ED) expenditures 
have to file Schedule 49. These corporations use this form 
to: 
■ identify all the associated corporations 
■ allocate the expenditure limit for the 35% ITC rate on 
qualifying SR&ED expenditures 
For more details about the ITC, see Lines 652 and 780 on 
page 88. 
Note 
Only one of the associated or related corporations needs 
to file Schedule 49 for a calendar year. However, if 
Schedule 49 is not already on file when the CRA assesses 
any of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar 
year of the agreement, it will ask for one. 
Associated corporations with more than one tax year in 
a calendar year 
Special rules apply to determine the expenditure limit for 
associated corporations that have more than one tax year 
ending in the same calendar year. Prorate the expenditure 
limit for each tax year ending in the calendar year based on 
the number of days in the tax year divided by 365. 
Be sure that the amount you prorate for each of the tax 
years is equal to the amount allocated to the corporation 
for the first tax year ending in the calendar year.

Schedule 28, Election not to be Associated 
Through a Third Corporation 
File Schedule 28 if a CCPC that is associated with two other 
corporations elects under subsection 256(2) for the 
two other corporations not to be associated with each other 
for the purposes of the small business deduction. 
Note 
Two corporations (Corps A and B) that are not 
associated with each other are considered associated 
under subsection 256(2) if they are associated with the 
same corporation (the third corporation). 
When the CCPC (the third corporation) makes this election, 
its business limit for the small business deduction is 
considered to be zero. 
Investment income received from either of the two other 
corporations’ active business will be ineligible for the small 
business deduction as it will not be treated as active 
business income. 
Corps A and B remain associated with the CCPC. They 
must include the taxable capital limit of the CCPC when 
calculating the small business deduction. 
The CCPC has to file a new election for each applicable tax 
year.

which it had a beneficial interest. If so, you have to 
complete and file Form T1142, Information Return in Respect 
of Distributions From and Indebtedness to a Non-Resident Trust. 
A separate form has to be filed for each non-resident trust.

A corporation may have transferred or loaned funds or 
property to a non-resident trust. If so, you may have to

of Contributions to Non-Resident Trusts, Arrangements or 
Entities.

Ownership of foreign property 
If, at any time in the year, the corporation owned or held 
specified foreign property where the total cost of all such 
property was more than CAN$100,000, you have to

Non-resident trusts (NRTs) and offshore investment 
fund property (OIFP) 
NRTs with a resident contributor or a resident beneficiary 
are deemed to be resident in Canada throughout the year 
for many purposes under the Act including determining 
the liability of the trust for tax under Part I. As deemed 
resident trusts, they will also have the obligation to 
withhold and remit Part XIII tax on amounts paid to 
non-residents. However, the deemed resident trusts 
themselves will not be liable under Part XIII. 
Also, the resident contributor and/or resident beneficiary 
are deemed to be jointly, severally, and solidarily liable for 
the trust’s Canadian tax liability and reporting obligations. 
This means that a corporation that is a resident contributor 
or resident beneficiary to a trust is jointly, severally, and 
solidarily liable for the Canadian tax liability and reporting 
obligation of that trust. 
Corporations with an interest in an OIFP may have to 
include an amount in their income as determined under the 
Act. 
For more information about NRTs and OIFP, including the 
specific definitions of resident contributor, resident 
beneficiary, and offshore investment fund property, call 
the CRA at one of the following numbers: 
■ 1-800-959-8281, from Canada and the continental 
United States 
■ 613-940-8495, from anywhere else. The CRA only accepts 
collect calls made through telephone operators. After 
your call is accepted by an automated response, you may 
hear a beep and notice a normal connection delay

Schedule 130, Excessive Interest and 
Financing Expenses Limitation

financing expenses (interest and financing expenses minus 
interest and financing revenues) that can be deducted. For 
tax years starting on or after January 1, 2024, the limit is 
generally equal to 30% of adjusted taxable income. As a 
transition measure, a ratio of 40% applies to tax years 
starting on or after October 1, 2023, and before 
January 1, 2024. 
Complete Schedule 130 for tax years starting on or after 
October 1, 2023, if the corporation is: 
■ subject to the EIFEL rules primarily contained in 
sections 18.2 and 18.21 of the Act (unless it meets the 
definition of an excluded entity), or 
■ a party to any election under the EIFEL rules 
An excluded entity for a tax year generally includes: 
■ a corporation that was a Canadian-controlled private 
corporation throughout the tax year that, together with 
any associated corporations, has taxable capital 
employed in Canada of less than $50 million 
■ a Canadian-resident corporation that, together with any 
eligible group entities, has aggregate net interest and 
financing expenses of $1 million or less 
■ a Canadian-resident corporation that, together with any 
eligible group entities: 
– carries on all or substantially all business, 
undertakings, and activities in Canada and has limited 
ties to non resident persons 
– has all or substantially all of its interest and financing 
expenses (IFE) paid or payable to persons or 
partnerships that are not tax-indifferent and that do 
not deal at arm’s length with the taxpayer or any 
eligible group entity 
For more details, see the definitions of excluded entity and 
eligible group entity in subsection 18.2(1). 
Subsection 18.2(18) requires a corporation that is subject to 
the EIFEL rules to file Schedule 130 to determine the 
deductibility of its IFE and to determine its exempt IFE. 
If a corporation does not file the Schedule 130, or files the 
schedule without including all the information required, 
paragraph 152(4)(b.8) allows the minister to reassess the 
return outside of the normal reassessment period.

The IFRS is mandatory for all publicly accountable 
enterprises. This includes corporations that have calculated 
their financial statements in accordance with the IFRS but 
have not complied with all aspects of the IFRS. A 
corporation that has issued, or is in a process of issuing, 
publicly-traded debt or equity instruments or who holds 
assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders 
is generally considered to be a publicly accountable 
enterprise. 
For the first year when IFRS is adopted, corporations are 
required to maintain additional documentation to support 
amounts filed on the General Index of Financial 
Information (GIFI) and tax returns. For more information 
on IFRS books and records and other IFRS topics, go 
to canada.ca/international-financial-reporting-standards 
-ifrs. 
Line 280 – Is the corporation inactive? 
Even if a corporation is inactive, which means it has not 
operated during the tax year, it has to file a return. 
Note 
Corporations that are inactive throughout the tax year 
and that do not have balance sheet or income statement 
information to report do not have to attach 
schedules 100, 125, and 141 to their T2 return. However, 
they will be accepted if filed. 
Lines 284 to 289 – Specify the principal 
products mined, manufactured, sold, 
constructed, or services provided, giving the 
approximate percentage of the total revenue 
that each product or service represents 
If you file electronically, enter the proper North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code before 
completing lines 284 to 289. If you do not select the 
business activity, you will have problems and errors when 
you prepare the T2 return to be transmitted electronically 
or printed in bar-code format. 
Break down the business activity into the following 
categories: 
■ the principal products mined, manufactured, sold, or 
constructed 
■ the services provided 
Also, give the approximate percentage of the corporation’s 
total revenue that each product or service represents. 
Line 290 – Did the corporation meet the 
definition of substantive CCPC under 
subsection 248(1) at any time in the tax year? 
Substantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using foreign 
entities 
A private corporation that is a Canadian-controlled private 
corporation (CCPC) is subject to refundable Part I tax, such 
that in certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for a 
private corporation to cease to be a CCPC. Tax planning 
strategies have developed that rely on a loss of CCPC status 
before the realization of investment income. 
The concept of substantive CCPC eliminates this potential 
advantage by taxing passive income earned by a 
substantive CCPC in the same way as if the corporation 
was a CCPC. 
A substantive CCPC is a private corporation (other than a 
CCPC) that at any time in a tax year: 
■ is controlled, directly or indirectly in any way, by one or 
more Canadian resident individuals, or 
■ would, if each share of the capital stock of a corporation 
that is owned by a Canadian resident individual were 
owned by a particular individual, be controlled by the 
particular individual 
Further, a corporation is considered a substantive CCPC 
when the corporation would be a CCPC but for the fact that 
a non-resident or public corporation has a right to acquire 
its shares. 
Measures regarding the deferral of tax using foreign 
entities generally apply to tax years ending after 
April 6, 2022, except that the measures apply to tax years 
starting after April 6, 2022, if both the following apply: 
■ the corporation’s first tax year ending after April 6, 2022, 
is because of an acquisition of control caused by the sale 
of all or substantially all of the shares of a corporation to 
an arm’s length purchaser before 2023 
■ the corresponding written purchase and sale agreement 
was entered into before April 7, 2022 
CCPC and substantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using 
foreign resident corporations 
Changes to the foreign accrual property income (FAPI) 
rules eliminate the tax deferral advantage that was 
available to CCPCs and their shareholders earning 
investment income through a controlled foreign affiliate. 
These measures, which affect both CCPCs and substantive 
CCPCs, apply to tax years starting after April 6, 2022. 
Aside from the two measures above, substantive CCPCs 
will continue to be treated as non-CCPCs for all other 
purposes of the Income Tax Act. 
Line 291 – Did the corporation immigrate to 
Canada during the tax year?

Line 292 – Did the corporation emigrate from 
Canada during the tax year? 
Tick the yes or no box. 
Line 293 – Do you want to be considered as a 
quarterly instalment remitter, if you are 
eligible? 
A small-CCPC is eligible to make quarterly instalment 
payments if it meets certain conditions. To determine if you 
are eligible, see Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation Instalment 
Guide. 
Line 294 – If the corporation was eligible to 
remit instalments on a quarterly basis for part 
of the tax year, provide the date the 
corporation ceased to be eligible. 
Indicate the date that the corporation ceased to be eligible 
to remit instalments on a quarterly basis. 
Line 295 – If the corporation’s major business 
activity is construction, did you have any 
subcontractors during the tax year? 
Tick the yes or no box. 
Major business activity 
All individuals, partnerships, and corporations whose 
principal business activity is construction have to report 
payments made to subcontractors. For these purposes, 
construction is defined as erecting, installing, altering, 
modifying, repairing, improving, demolishing, 
dismantling, or removing any structure or part, including 
but not limited to buildings, roads, and bridges. 
Who is a subcontractor? 
A subcontractor is an individual, partnership, or 
corporation that provides construction services.

Calculating net income or loss 
There are several schedules you may have to use to 
calculate the net income or loss for income tax purposes. 
This section explains each of those schedules. 
Schedule 1, Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax 
Purposes 
Effective January 1, 2024, any deduction from income from 
non-compliant short-term rentals is disallowed to the extent 
of the non-compliant amount. On line 295 of Schedule 1, 
enter the non-deductible amount for non-compliant short-
term rentals. 
Generally, the net income (loss) reported on your financial 
statements will not be the same as the net income (loss) 
required for tax purposes. This is because certain income 
and expenses reported on your financial statements or the 
General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) may not be 
used in the calculation of net income (loss) for tax purposes. 
For example, you do not deduct charitable donations when 
determining net income for tax purposes, as you would to 
arrive at net income on your financial statement. 
Note 
Charitable donations are deducted (afterward) from net 
income for tax purposes to arrive at taxable income. 
Use Schedule 1 to reconcile the net income (loss) reported 
on your financial statements and the net income (loss) 
required for tax purposes. 
Enter net income or loss after income tax and extraordinary 
items at amount A, page 1 of Schedule 1. Add the taxable 
items and the non-allowable expenses listed on lines 101 
to 199 and subtract from this the non-taxable items and 
eligible expenses listed on lines 401 to 499. 
Additions and deductions identified on lines 101 to 132 
and 401 to 418 of Schedule 1 are the most common 
additions and subtractions. For other additions and 
deductions, see pages 3 and 4. 
Some expenses deducted on your income statement are not 
allowable for income tax purposes and are not identified on 
Schedule 1. In this case, use columns 605 and 295, and 
line 296, “Other additions”, on page 3. 
Also, certain items included in income that are not taxable 
are not identified on this schedule. In such cases, complete 
columns 705 and 395, and line 396, “Other deductions”, on 
page 4. 
Notes 
Only complete lines 203 and 302 if you are converting 
from an accrual basis to a cash basis. Otherwise, these 
lines should be left blank. 
The deductible portion of expenses you incurred for 
food, beverages, and entertainment is only 50% of 
whichever is less: the expenditure actually incurred or 
the amount that would be reasonable in the 
circumstances. 
Eighty percent of expenses for food and beverages 
consumed by a long-haul truck driver during an eligible 
travel period are deductible. For more information, see 
Guide T4002, Self-Employed Business, Professional, 
Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income, or go 
to canada.ca/taxes-employment-expenses and select 
“Transportation employees.” 
A full deduction is allowed for meals provided to an 
employee at a temporary construction work camp, if 
certain conditions are met. For more information on this 
subject, go to canada.ca/taxable-benefit. 
Taxable capital gains or allowable capital losses allocated 
by a partnership to a corporate partner are not included 
on line 129 of Schedule 1 of the corporate partner. 
Instead, the corporate partner’s share of the 
partnership’s capital gain or loss should be reported on 
Schedule 6 of the corporate partner. 
You may have to use the following schedules to calculate 
certain amounts on Schedule 1: 
■ Schedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of Capital Property (for 
details, see below)

■ Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) (see page 45) 
■ Schedule 12, Resource-Related Deductions (see page 64) 
■ Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves (see page 64) 
■ Schedule 16, Patronage Dividend Deduction (see page 65) 
■ Schedule 17, Credit Union Deductions (see page 65) 
■ Schedule 73, Income Inclusion Summary for Corporations 
that Are Members of Partnerships (see page 15) 
■ Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental 
Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim (see page 65) 
Schedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of 
Capital Property 
You have to complete Schedule 6 if you disposed of capital 
property during the tax year and incurred any capital 
losses or realized any capital gains. You also have to 
complete this schedule if you claim an allowable business 
investment loss.

Designation under paragraph 111(4)(e) 
Answer yes or no to the question on line 050, page 1 of 
Schedule 6. 
You can make a designation under paragraph 111(4)(e) if a 
person or group of persons has acquired control of the 
corporation. If you make the designation, capital properties 
will be considered as having been disposed of immediately 
before that person or group of persons acquired control of 
the corporation. 
Completing Schedule 6 
To help you complete Schedule 6, the following 
explanations briefly set out the type of information to enter 
in each column and each part of the schedule. 
Date of acquisition 
In this column, give the date you acquired the property. 
Proceeds of disposition 
In this column, indicate the proceeds of disposition. The 
proceeds of disposition are usually the selling price of the 
property. However, they can also include compensation 
the corporation received for property that was destroyed, 
expropriated, stolen, or damaged. 
For a gift or a deemed disposition, the proceeds of 
disposition are usually the fair market value of the property 
when its owner or use changes.

S3-F3-C1, Replacement Property 
Adjusted cost base 
In this column, indicate the cost of the property you used to 
calculate any capital gain or loss. This amount is called the 
adjusted cost base (ACB). The ACB is the original cost of 
the property that has been adjusted to reflect certain 
transactions or occurrences that took place after acquiring 
the property. 
The cost of a capital property may be the actual cost, a 
deemed cost, or the valuation-day value of the property. 
The nature of the property and the circumstances under 
which you acquired it determine which cost of the capital 
property you should use. 
References 
Subsections 53(1) and 53(2) 
The cost of property acquired after 1971 is usually the 
actual cost of acquiring it, including the purchase price plus 
any related costs, such as commissions, legal fees, and other 
reasonable expenses. It also includes the cost of additions 
and improvements to the property. It does not include 
current expenses, such as maintenance and repair costs. 
Special rules apply when determining the cost of capital 
property owned on December 31, 1971. According to these 
rules, tax is not assessed and losses are not allowed for any 
gain or loss that arose before that date. 
When deductions from the cost base of a property (other 
than a partnership interest) reduce the balance to a negative 
amount at any time in the tax year, you are considered to 
have realized a capital gain equal to the amount of the 
negative balance, and the ACB becomes nil. 
You cannot use later additions to the ACB to reduce 
previous gains on the property that resulted from a 
negative balance. You can only consider these additions 
when you determine future gains or losses. 
Reference 
Subsection 40(3) 
Paragraphs 53(1)(e) and 53(2)(c) outline the rules for 
determining the ACB of a partnership interest. 
You have to reduce the ACB of a partnership interest by the 
amount of any share purchase tax credit, and one-half of 
any scientific research and experimental development tax 
credit the partnership allocated to the corporation. 
Note 
Interests in a partnership that a limited partner or an 
inactive partner holds are subject to the negative 
ACB rule. 
Outlays and expenses 
In this column, enter the amount of outlays and expenses 
you deducted when calculating a gain or loss. You can 
deduct most cash outlays the corporation used to put a 
property into saleable condition when you calculate a gain 
or loss. You can also deduct expenses incurred when 
disposing of the property. These expenses include certain 
fixing-up costs, finder’s fees, commissions, surveyor’s fees, 
transfer taxes, and other reasonable expenses incurred to 
dispose of the property. 
Gain (or loss) 
In the last column, enter the amount of the gain or loss as 
instructed. 
A capital gain results when the proceeds of disposition of a 
capital property are more than the ACB and any related 
outlays or expenses. A capital loss occurs when the 
proceeds of disposition are less than the ACB and the 
related outlays and expenses. However, if depreciable

property is disposed of, it will result in a terminal loss, not 
a capital loss. See “Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated 
capital cost) on page 51 for more details about terminal 
losses. 
In certain cases, when you dispose of a building and the 
land on which it stands, and the building is disposed of for 
less than its undepreciated capital cost, you may have to 
reduce the gain on the sale of the land by the terminal loss 
on the sale of the building. 
Reference 
Subsection 13(21.1) 
If you dispose of crypto-assets and other similar properties 
other than in the course of a business that you operate or an 
adventure in the nature of trade, the CRA may consider any 
resulting gain or loss to be a capital gain or capital loss. For 
more information, go to canada.ca/cra-crypto-assets or see 
Guide T4037, Capital Gains. 
Categories of capital property 
There are six categories of capital property you may have 
disposed of during the tax year. The categories are: 
■ shares 
■ real estate 
■ bonds 
■ other properties 
■ personal-use property 
■ listed personal property 
The first six parts of Schedule 6 reflect these six categories 
of capital property. 
Part 1 – Shares 
In this part, list the shares disposed of during the tax year. 
Give the number of shares, the name of the corporation in 
which the shares were held, and the class of the shares. 
Usually, disposing of a share of the capital stock of a 
corporation will result in a taxable capital gain or an 
allowable capital loss. However, if the corporation that is 
disposing of the share is in the business of trading shares, 
the resulting gain or loss is considered business income or 
loss. 
If a share is converted because of a merger or an 
amalgamation, subsection 248(1) deems a disposition to 
have occurred. 
Under paragraph 112(3)(b), a corporation (the shareholder) 
must reduce the losses from the disposition of shares held 
as capital property by certain dividends received for those 
shares. This is called a stop-loss rule. Generally, this rule 
does not apply when the shareholder owns less than 5% of 
the shares and has held these shares for over a year. 
On line 160, enter the total adjustment for such losses 
identified in Part 1. Enter the total amount of gain or loss 
realized on disposition of shares at amount A. 
Reference 
IT-328, Losses on Shares on Which Dividends Have Been Received 
Part 2 – Real estate 
In this part, list all real estate disposed of during the tax 
year. Give the municipal address of each property. 
Dispositions of non-depreciable real property (unless the 
property is inventory) may result in a capital gain or loss. 
However, dispositions of depreciable property may result 
in a capital gain, a recapture of CCA, or a terminal loss. 
See ”Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated capital cost) on 
page 51 for details about terminal losses and recaptures. 
Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on 
disposition of real estate at amount B.

Farmland and Inherited Land and Conversion of Real Estate From Capital 
Property to Inventory and Vice Versa 
Part 3 – Bonds 
In this part, list all bonds disposed of during the tax year. 
Give the face value, the maturity date, and the issuer’s 
name for each type of bond. 
When you make a capital disposition of a debt obligation, 
the amount of any realized discount or bonus received is 
usually considered a capital gain. Similarly, a premium 
paid is considered a capital loss, either when the obligation 
matures or on the date you dispose of the obligation. 
Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on 
disposition of bonds at amount C. 
Reference 
IT-479, Transactions in Securities 
Part 4 – Other properties 
In this part, describe any capital property disposed of 
during the tax year that you have not already reported in 
Parts 1, 2, and 3. 
Other property includes capital debts established as bad 
debts, debts in respect of the disposition of personal-use 
property established as bad debts, amounts that arise from 
foreign currency transactions, as well as capital gains or 
losses allocated from partnerships and trusts. 
When an amount receivable on a capital account becomes 
a bad debt and you elect on your return to have the 
provisions of subsection 50(1) applied, a deemed 
disposition occurs at the end of the year. You are 
considered to have reacquired the debt immediately 
afterwards at a cost of nil. This usually allows the 
corporation to claim a bad debt as a capital loss in the year. 
Any later recovery of that debt will result in a capital gain. 
References 
Subsection 50(1) 
IT-159, Capital Debts Established to be Bad Debts 
You can deduct, per subsection 50(2), capital losses in 
respect of bad debts relating to the disposition of 
personal-use property to a person with whom you deal at 
arm’s length. 
The amount of the loss cannot be more than the amount of 
the gain reported on the disposition of the personal-use 
property. 
Reference 
Subsection 50(2) 
Foreign exchange gains or losses from buying or selling 
capital properties are capital gains or capital losses.

Transactions in foreign currency or foreign currency futures 
that do not form part of the business operations can be 
considered capital dispositions. 
References 
Subsection 39(2) 
IT-95, Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses 
For dispositions of depreciable property, a capital gain 
results if the proceeds are more than the capital cost. 
However, losses on depreciable property do not result in 
capital losses. These losses are terminal losses. See 
“Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated capital cost) on 
page 51 to find out more about terminal losses. 
Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on 
disposition of other properties at amount D. 
Part 5 – Personal-use property 
In this part, describe any personal-use property you 
disposed of during the tax year. 
Personal-use property of a corporation is property owned 
mainly for the personal use or enjoyment of an individual 
who is related to the corporation. 
Use the $1,000 rule to determine gains and losses when you 
dispose of personal-use property. According to this rule, if 
the adjusted cost base is less than $1,000, it is considered to 
be $1,000. As well, when the proceeds of disposition are less 
than $1,000, they are considered to be $1,000. 
The $1,000 rule will not apply when donors acquire 
personal-use property as part of an arrangement in which 
the property is gifted to a qualified donee, such as a 
registered charity. 
You cannot deduct losses on dispositions of personal-use 
property (other than listed personal property or a debt that 
is personal-use property) from your income. 
Enter the total amount of gain realized on disposition of 
personal-use property at amount E. 
Reference 
Subsection 46(1) 
Part 6 – Listed personal property 
In this part, describe any listed personal property disposed 
of during the tax year. 
Listed personal property is a special category of 
personal-use property that usually increases in value. The 
following is a complete list of the different types of listed 
personal property: 
■ prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other 
similar works of art 
■ jewellery 
■ rare folios, rare manuscripts, or rare books 
■ stamps 
■ coins 
If you incur losses from disposing of listed personal 
property, you can only deduct these losses from capital 
gains realized from disposing of listed personal property. 
On line 655, enter the amount of listed personal property 
losses from previous years you want to apply against 
current-year net listed personal property gains. Also, enter 
this amount on line 530 of Schedule 4, Corporation Loss 
Continuity and Application. 
You can apply any unabsorbed losses in the current year to 
reduce similar net gains realized in the three preceding 
years, and in the following seven years. See “Part 5 – Listed 
personal property losses” on page 68 for more details. 
At amount F, enter the total amount of gains or losses 
realized on disposition of listed personal property minus 
the amount of line 655. 
Part 7 – Property qualifying for and resulting in an 
allowable business investment loss 
Generally, a business investment loss arises from the arm’s 
length disposition (or deemed disposition) of: 
■ shares of a small business corporation 
■ certain debts owed to the corporation by a small business 
corporation, certain bankrupt corporations, or certain 
wound-up corporations (these corporations have to deal 
with the corporation at arm’s length) 
A small business corporation is defined in subsection 248(1). 
Complete Part 7 to calculate the business investment losses 
at amount G. 
Capital gains reserve 
Often, you will not receive part of the proceeds of 
disposition, usually for real property, until after the end of 
the year. In these cases, you can defer part of the capital 
gain to the year the corporation is due to receive the 
proceeds by setting up a capital gains reserve. By using 
reserves, you can spread a capital gain over a maximum of 
five years. 
Generally, a corporation that has made a gift of a 
non-qualifying security to a qualified donee may claim a 
reserve for any gain realized on this security. The reserve 
claimed by the corporation cannot exceed the eligible 
amount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift is the 
amount by which the fair market value of the property that 
is the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of the 
advantage, if any, in respect of the gift. 
A reserve can only be claimed if the donation is not 
deducted for tax purposes and the donee does not dispose 
of the security or the security does not cease to be a 
non-qualifying security. This reserve can only be claimed in 
tax years ending within 60 months of making the gift. 
The reserve must be included in income if the corporation 
becomes a non-resident or tax exempt. 
The reserve that you can claim in a tax year cannot be more 
than the lesser of the following two amounts: 
A.          Capital gain           × Amount not due until after 
 
Proceeds of disposition  
 
the end of the year 
and 
B. 
■ for the year of disposition 
4/5 of the capital gain 
 
■ for the second year 
3/5 of the capital gain 
 
■ for the third year 
2/5 of the capital gain 
 
■ for the fourth year 
1/5 of the capital gain

Subparagraphs 40(1)(a)(ii) and 40(1)(a)(iii) 
Subsection 40(1.01) 
Part 8 – Capital gains or losses 
When completing this part, line 875 is the capital gains 
dividends. Capital gains dividends under 
paragraphs 130.1(4)(a) and (b) and 131(1)(a) and (b) are 
considered to be capital gains. These paragraphs apply to 
mortgage investment corporations and mutual fund 
corporations. If you received any capital gains dividends in 
the tax year, enter them on this line. 
Line 880 is the balance at the beginning of the year of the 
capital gains reserve from Schedule 13. This amount should 
include any amount from the last tax year of predecessor 
corporations after amalgamation or wind-up. 
Part 9 – Taxable capital gains and total capital losses 
Generally, a zero inclusion rate applies for capital gains 
arising as a result of a gift to qualified donees of certain 
securities or of environmentally sensitive land. The zero 
inclusion rate is restricted to only part of the capital gain if 
the taxpayer is entitled to an advantage or benefit in respect 
of a gift. 
When completing this part, line 895 is the full amount of 
capital gains realized on donations of a security listed on a 
designated stock exchange, a share or unit of a mutual 
fund, an interest in a segregated fund, or a prescribed debt 
obligation made to a qualified donee. 
Generally, if you donate property to a qualified donee that 
is included in a flow-through share class of property, and 
you have an exemption threshold for the flow-through 
share class of property, you may be deemed to have an 
additional capital gain from the disposition of another 
capital property subject to the 50% inclusion rate. 
Amounts under section 34.2 (the adjusted stub period 
accrual regime) that have the character of capital are to be 
entered in this part of Schedule 6 and not on line 130 of 
Schedule 1. 
Since these amounts are deemed to be taxable capital 
gains/allowable capital losses under the rules in 
section 34.2 and so already reflect the 50% inclusion rate, 
they are multiplied by 2 on Schedule 6 to calculate the total 
capital gains or losses of the corporation. 
In general, if you dispose of an interest in a partnership to 
tax-exempt entities, non-resident persons, or partnerships 
and trusts that have such members or beneficiaries, a 
special rule may apply. 
Under subsection 100(1), part of the capital gain may be 
subject to the 50% inclusion rate and another part may be 
subject to a 100% inclusion rate. 
The portion of the capital gain that can reasonably be 
attributed to increases in the value of capital property 
(other than depreciable property) held directly by the 
partnership (or held indirectly by the partnership through 
one or more other partnerships) is subject to the 50% 
inclusion rate and the rest is subject to the 100% inclusion 
rate. 
If all the partnership assets are inventory, depreciable 
property, or resource property, then the capital gain would 
be subject to the 100% inclusion rate unless an exception 
applies. If there is also capital property (other than 
depreciable property), then it’s an apportionment. 
If subsection 100(1) applies, enter the result of the portion 
of the capital gain that is subject to the 100% inclusion rate 
multiplied by 2 on line 902. Enter the portion of the capital 
gain that is subject to the 50% inclusion rate in Part 4. 
Amount P is the capital gain or loss for the year. If the 
amount is a loss, enter it at amount Q of Schedule 6 and 
line 210 of Schedule 4. If the amount is a gain, enter the 
result of amount P multiplied by 1/2 at amount R of 
Schedule 6 and line 113 of Schedule 1.

You can deduct an ABIL from all sources of income for the 
year. If any balance remains after the year the loss occurs, 
it becomes part of the non-capital loss. You can carry the 
non-capital loss back 3 tax years and carry it forward 10 tax 
years. 
If you are unable to deduct an ABIL as a non-capital loss 
within this allowed time frame, the unused part becomes a 
net capital loss, and you can carry it forward indefinitely to 
reduce taxable capital gains. 
Include all unused ABIL after the applicable carry-forward 
period in Part 2, “Capital losses”, of Schedule 4. See 
page 67, for more details.

Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) 
Paragraph 20(1)(a) allows a corporation to deduct part of 
the capital cost of certain depreciable property from 
income it earned in the year from a business or property. 
This deduction is called capital cost allowance. 
Complete Schedule 8 to calculate CCA. 
When a tax year is shorter than 12 months, you generally 
have to prorate the CCA. 
Under Part XI of the Income Tax Regulations, depreciable 
property is grouped into prescribed classes. Schedule II of 
the Regulations contains a complete list of these prescribed 
classes. 
A maximum rate is prescribed for each class. Apply the 
prescribed rate to the undepreciated capital cost of the class 
at year-end to determine the maximum CCA you can claim. 
You can deduct any amount up to the maximum that is 
available for the year. 
Disability-related modifications 
You can deduct outlays and expenses you incur for eligible 
disability-related modifications made to a building in the

year you paid them, instead of having to add them to the 
capital cost of your building. Eligible disability-related 
modifications include changes you make to accommodate 
wheelchairs. You can also deduct expenses paid to install or 
get disability-related devices and equipment. 
You can claim this as “Other deductions” on Schedule 1, 
Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes. 
Available-for-use rule 
The available-for-use rule determines the earliest tax year in 
which you can claim CCA for depreciable property. 
When is property available for use? 
Property other than a building is considered available for 
use at the earliest of several dates. The following are some 
examples of these dates: 
■ when the corporation first uses the property to earn 
income 
■ the beginning of the first tax year that starts at 
least 358 days after the tax year during which the 
corporation acquired the property 
■ immediately before the corporation disposes of the 
property 
■ when the corporation can use the property to either 
produce a saleable product or perform a saleable service 
A building is considered available for use on the earliest of 
the following dates: 
■ when the corporation uses all or substantially all of the 
building for its intended purpose 
■ when construction of the building is completed 
■ the beginning of the first tax year that starts at 
least 358 days after the tax year during which the 
corporation acquired the property 
■ immediately before the corporation disposes of the 
property 
■ when the corporation acquires a replacement property, 
if it is replacing one it involuntarily disposed of 
(for example, expropriation) that it either acquired 
before 1990 or had already become available for use 
Note 
If a corporation acquires a property for a long-term 
project, it can elect to limit the impact of the 
available-for-use rule. This election is not available for 
rental buildings. To make this election, send the CRA a 
completed Form T1031, Subsection 13(29) Election in 
Respect of Certain Depreciable Properties, Acquired for use in 
a Long Term Project, with your return.

Election under Regulation 1101(5q) 
Line 101 – Is the corporation electing under 
Regulation 1101(5q)? 
Tick the yes or no box. 
This election allows you to include certain property usually 
included in classes 8 and 43 in a separate class. You have to 
have acquired each property at a capital cost of at least 
$1,000. The types of properties that qualify for this election 
include manufacturing and processing property, 
photocopiers, and electronic communications equipment, 
such as facsimile transmission devices or telephone 
equipment. 
You can elect to classify a property in a separate class or 
several properties in one or more than one separate class. 
This election can allow you to claim a terminal loss, which 
is any remaining undepreciated capital cost at the time of 
disposition of the properties in this class. For more 
information on terminal losses, see “Column 10 – UCC” 
(undepreciated capital cost). 
CCA rates and classes 
Purpose-built rental housing – Class 1 
Under proposed changes, an accelerated CCA rate of 10% 
under class 1 would be available for new eligible purpose-
built rental housing projects that: 
■ begin construction after April 15, 2024, and before 2031, 
and 
■ are available for use before 2036 
Investments eligible for this measure would continue to 
benefit from the accelerated investment incentive (AII). The 
AII currently suspends the half-year rule, providing a CCA 
deduction at the full rate for eligible property that becomes 
available for use before 2028. 
Eligible property would be new purpose-built rental 
housing that is a residential complex: 
■ with at least 4 private apartment units (a unit with a 
private kitchen, bathroom, and living areas) or 10 private 
rooms or suites, and 
■ in which at least 90% of residential units are held for 
long-term rental 
If the above conditions are met, the new rate would also be 
available to: 
■ projects that convert existing non-residential real estate, 
such as an office building, into a residential complex 
■ new additions to an existing residential complex 
The accelerated CCA would not apply to renovations of 
existing residential complexes. 
Productivity-enhancing assets – Classes 44, 46, and 50 
Under proposed changes, for new additions of property to 
CCA classes 44, 46, and 50, immediate expensing (a 100% 
first-year deduction) would be provided if the property is 
acquired after April 15, 2024, and becomes available for use 
before 2027. Property that becomes available for use in 2027 
would continue to benefit from the AII. 
Zero-emission vehicles – Classes 54 and 55 
Two CCA classes (54 and 55) were added for zero-emission 
vehicles (ZEVs) acquired after March 18, 2019. 
Class 55 was created for zero-emission vehicles otherwise 
included in class 16, essentially automobiles for lease or 
rent and taxicabs, with the same CCA rate of 40%. Class 54 
was created for zero-emission vehicles that would 
otherwise be included in class 10 or 10.1, essentially other



=== 第 47 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
47
automobiles, with the same CCA rate of 30%. The CCA still 
applies on a declining-balance basis. 
A corporation may elect to not include in class 54 or 55 a 
vehicle that would otherwise be a zero-emission vehicle. 
When such an election is filed, the vehicle will no longer be 
considered to be a zero-emission vehicle. As a result, the 
vehicle will be included in its usual CCA class 10, 10.1 
or 16. A corporation has to file this election with the 
minister of National Revenue in its return of income for the 
tax year in which the vehicle is acquired. 
An eligible zero-emission vehicle is essentially a motor 
vehicle for use on streets and highways (excluding a trolley 
bus or vehicle operated only on rails). It must be fully 
electric, or a plug-in hybrid that has a battery capacity of at 
least 7 kWh, or fully powered by hydrogen. It must not 
have been used, or acquired for use, for any purpose before 
it was acquired by the corporation, unless the corporation 
acquires it after March 1, 2020. 
It cannot be a vehicle: 
■ for which the Government of Canada paid assistance 
under a prescribed program such as the federal purchase 
incentive announced in the 2019 federal budget 
(presently there is only one prescribed program) 
■ that the corporation elected not to include in class 54 
or 55 
■ for which an amount has been deducted as CCA or a 
terminal loss has been claimed by another person or 
partnership 
In addition, a zero-emission vehicle has to be acquired, and 
become available for use, after March 18, 2019, and 
before 2028. An enhanced first-year CCA is available as 
follows: 
■ 100% after March 18, 2019, and before 2024 
■ 75% after 2023 and before 2026 
■ 55% after 2025 and before 2028 
Under proposed changes, the immediate expensing 
measure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for 
qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, 
and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a 
four-year phase out after 2029. 
For the enhanced first-year allowance, the following step 
should be done before calculating the CCA: 
■ increase the net capital cost addition to the new class for 
property that becomes available for use before 2028 as 
follows: 
– For class 54, increase the capital cost addition by an 
amount equal to: 
■ 2 1/3 times the net addition to the class for property 
that becomes available for use before 2024 
■ 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property 
that becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025 
■ 5/6 times the net addition to the class for property 
that becomes available for use after 2025 and 
before 2028 
– For class 55, increase the capital cost addition by an 
amount equal to: 
■ 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property 
that becomes available for use before 2024 
■ 7/8 times the net addition to the class for property 
that becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025 
■ 3/8 times the net addition to the class for property 
that becomes available for use after 2025 and 
before 2028 
■ suspend the existing CCA half-year rule 
Multiply the result by the prescribed CCA rate of 30% for 
class 54 and 40% for class 55. 
The CCA will apply to any remaining balance for the new 
classes using the set rate for each class. 
These measures do not change the total amount that can be 
deducted over the life of the vehicle, it just allows a larger 
deduction in the first year. 
A zero-emission passenger vehicle is an automobile that is 
included in class 54. When the capital cost of a 
zero-emission passenger vehicle is more than a prescribed 
amount ($61,000 plus sales tax for vehicles acquired on or 
after January 1, 2023), the capital cost of the vehicle is 
deemed to be the prescribed amount. This amount will be 
reviewed annually. 
If a zero-emission passenger vehicle is disposed of to a 
person or partnership with which the corporation deals at 
arm’s length and its cost is more than the prescribed 
amount, the proceeds of disposition will be adjusted based 
on a factor equal to the prescribed amount as a proportion 
of the actual cost of the vehicle. But for dispositions made 
after July 29, 2019, the actual cost of the vehicle will be 
adjusted for payment or repayment of government 
assistance. 
Zero-emission vehicles – Class 56 
A temporary enhanced first-year capital cost 
allowance (CCA) of 100% is available for eligible 
zero-emission automotive equipment and vehicles (other 
than motor vehicles) that currently do not benefit from the 
accelerated rate provided by classes 54 and 55. These 
vehicles and equipment are included in class 56. They have 
to be acquired after March 1, 2020, and become available for 
use before 2028. 
The enhanced CCA applies only for the tax year in which 
the equipment or vehicle first becomes available for use. It 
is subject to the following phase-out: 
■ 100% after March 1, 2020, and before 2024 
■ 75% after 2023 and before 2026 
■ 55% after 2025 and before 2028 
Under proposed changes, the immediate expensing 
measure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for 
qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, 
and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a 
four-year phase out after 2029. 
To be eligible for the enhanced first year allowance, a 
vehicle or equipment must be automotive (that is,

canada.ca/taxes 
48
self-propelled) and fully electric or powered by hydrogen. 
Vehicles or equipment that are powered partially by 
electricity or hydrogen (which includes hybrid vehicles and 
vehicles that require human or animal power for 
propulsion) are not eligible. 
Class 56 captures automotive equipment that is not 
designed for use on highways or streets such as 
zero-emission aircraft, watercraft, trolley buses and railway 
locomotives. Additions or alterations may qualify if they 
convert automotive equipment (other than a motor vehicle) 
into a zero-emission property. 
The CCA is deductible on any remaining balance on a 
declining balance basis at a rate of 30%. 
An election is available to not include the vehicle or 
equipment in class 56. As a result, the property will then be 
included in the class for which it would otherwise be 
eligible. 
Class 56 excludes property for which CCA or a terminal 
loss has previously been claimed by another person or 
partnership where the equipment was acquired by the 
corporation on a tax-deferred “rollover” basis or it was 
previously owned or acquired by the corporation or a 
non-arm’s length person or partnership. 
Accelerated investment incentive property 
Accelerated investment incentive property (AIIP) is a 
property (other than property included in classes 54 to 56) 
that is acquired by the corporation after November 20, 2018, 
and becomes available for use before 2028. 
Under proposed changes, the accelerated investment 
incentive measure would be reinstated for qualifying 
property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that 
becomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year 
phase out after 2029. 
The property has to meet one of the following conditions: 
■ no person or partnership (including the corporation) has 
claimed capital cost allowance (or a terminal loss) for the 
property 
■ it has not been transferred to the corporation on a 
tax-deferred “rollover” basis 
■ it was not previously owned or acquired by the 
corporation or a non-arm’s length person or partnership 
The following measures are available to AIIP: 
■ Accelerated investment incentive – Providing an 
enhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible 
property that is subject to the CCA rules. In general, the 
incentive is made up of two elements: 
– an increase up to 50% of the net capital cost addition to 
a class for property that becomes available for use 
before 2024 
– suspending the existing CCA half-year rule (and 
equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and class 13 
property) for property that becomes available for use 
before 2028. 
 
Note 
Under the half-year rule, in general, property other 
than AIIP or property included in classes 54 to 56, 
acquired during the tax year, is eligible for only 50% of 
the normal maximum CCA for the year. You can claim 
full CCA for that property in the next tax year. See 
Regulation 1100(2). 
■ Full expensing for manufacturers and processors – 
Allowing businesses to immediately write off the full 
cost of machinery and equipment used for the 
manufacturing or processing of goods (class 53 or 
property included in class 43 and acquired after 2025, if 
the property would have been included in class 53 if it 
had been acquired in 2025). 
■ Full expensing for clean energy investments – Allowing 
businesses to immediately write off the full cost of 
specified clean energy equipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). 
A phase-out will begin for property that becomes available 
for use after 2023. For the 2024 and 2025 years, corporations 
may immediately write off 75% of specified clean energy 
equipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). 
Under proposed changes, the immediate expensing 
measure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for 
qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, 
and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a 
four-year phase out after 2029. 
An enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible 
Canadian development expenses and Canadian oil and gas 
property expenses incurred after November 20, 2018, and 
before 2028. The enhanced deduction will begin to be 
phased out for expenses made after 2023. 
The accelerated investment incentive applies to property 
for which CCA is calculated on a declining-balance basis 
(including class 14.1, intangible property), as well as 
property with straight-line depreciation (for example, 
leasehold improvement, patents, and limited period 
licences). A phase-out will begin for property that becomes 
available for use after 2023. 
In certain situations, rules related to limited partners, 
specified leasing properties, specified energy properties 
and rental properties can restrict a CCA deduction, or a loss 
for such a deduction, that would otherwise be available. 
These rules continue to apply. 
The accelerated investment incentive does not change the 
total amount that can be deducted over the life of the 
property, it just allows a larger deduction in the first year.

Designated immediate expensing property 
Designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) is a 
property (other than property included in classes 1 to 6, 
14.1, 17, 47, 49 and 51) that is acquired by a CCPC after 
April 18, 2021, becomes available for use in the tax year and 
before 2024, is designated as such in prescribed form filed 
by the CCPC within 12 months of the filing-due date for the 
tax year the designation relates to.

The property has to meet one of the two following 
conditions: 
■ it has never been used and no person or partnership has 
claimed capital cost allowance (or a terminal loss) for the 
property 
■ it has not been transferred to the corporation on a tax 
deferred “rollover” basis and it was not previously 
owned or acquired by the corporation or a non-arm’s 
length person or partnership 
Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA), is the prescribed 
form for the immediate expensing claim. 
The immediate expensing incentive has the following 
characteristics: 
■ it allows CCPCs to immediately write off the full cost of 
the DIEP up to $1.5 million per tax year 
■ it applies only to the DIEP 
■ it is available only for the year in which the property 
becomes available for use 
■ it is limited to $1.5 million per tax year, which will be 
shared among associated members of a group and 
prorated for tax years shorter than 365 days. If the capital 
cost of the DIEP is more than $1.5 million and is included 
in more than one CCA class, the CCPC can decide to 
which CCA class the immediate expensing incentive is 
attributed 
Note 
The immediate expensing deduction does not need to be 
prorated for a short tax year, as the immediate expensing 
deduction is already limited to the corporation’s 
prorated immediate expensing limit for the tax year. 
This applies to tax years ending after April 18, 2021. 
The carryforward of excess capacity for CCPCs with less 
than $1.5 million of eligible capital costs is not allowed. 
Existing enhanced CCA deductions will not reduce the 
amount available under this measure. 
For details, see examples 6 and 7 under the heading 
“Schedule 8 examples” that follows. 
Completing Schedule 8 
This section explains how to complete each column of 
Schedule 8. Use a separate line for each class of property. 
Reference 
S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance 
Complete Part 1 if you are associated (under 
subsection 1104(3.6) of the Regulations) in the tax year with 
one or more eligible persons or partnerships (EPOPs) with 
which you have entered into an agreement. The purpose of 
the agreement is to assign a percentage to one or more of 
the EPOPs in the tax year to share the immediate expensing 
limit. 
EPOP refers to a corporation that was a CCPC throughout 
the year, an individual (other than a trust) resident in 
Canada throughout the year or a Canadian partnership all 
of the members of which were individuals (other than 
trusts) or CCPCs throughout the period. 
In the table, give the names of the associated EPOPs, their 
identification number and the percentage assigned under 
the agreement. Also provide the immediate expensing limit 
allocated to you. Such amount should be based on the 
percentage assigned to your corporation in column 3. If the 
sum of the percentages assigned under the agreement is 
more than 100%, the immediate expensing limit of the 
associated group is nil. 
Reference 
Regulations 1104(3.1) to (3.6) 
Complete Part 2 to calculate your CCA deduction. 
Column 1 – Class number 
Identify each class of property with the assigned class 
number. 
Generally, you have to group all depreciable property of 
the same class together. Then, calculate CCA on the 
undepreciated capital cost of all the property in that class. 
However, sometimes you have to maintain property of the 
same class in separate lines. For example, list on separate 
lines property that you would usually group in the same 
class but use to earn income from different sources. Also, 
list on a separate line each class 10.1 passenger vehicle and 
property you elected to identify in a separate class under 
Regulation 1101(5q). 
Note 
If a class number has not been provided in Schedule II 
of the Income Tax Regulations for a particular class 
of property, use the subsection provided in 
Regulation 1101 or 1100.

Column 2 – Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the 
beginning of the year 
Enter the amount of the undepreciated capital cost at the 
end of the previous tax year. 
Column 3 – Cost of acquisitions during the year 
For each class, enter the total cost of depreciable property 
you acquired in the tax year. Depreciable property is 
considered acquired when it becomes available for use. See 
page 46 for more information on the available-for-use rule. 
Reduce the capital cost of a property by the following 
amounts: 
■ goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) 
input tax credit claimed or entitled to be claimed, or 
rebate received or entitled to be received in the year 
■ federal investment tax credits (ITCs), other than scientific 
research and experimental development ITCs, used to 
reduce taxes payable or claimed as a refund in the 
previous tax year 
■ reduction of capital cost after the application of section 80 
■ provincial or territorial ITCs received or entitled to be 
received in the current year 
■ government assistance received or entitled to be received 
in the year and described under paragraph 13(7.1)(f) 
■ deemed decrease, under subsection 13(40), to the 
undepreciated capital cost of class 14.1 where you

acquired property of that class through a non-arm’s 
length transfer and the property had been eligible capital 
property of the transferor before January 1, 2017 
Add to the capital cost of the property: 
■ deemed increase, under subsection 13(39), to the 
undepreciated capital cost of class 14.1 where you 
disposed of property of that class after 
December 31, 2016, and that property had been eligible 
capital property before January 1, 2017 
■ repayment of GST/HST input tax credit previously 
claimed 
■ government assistance repaid in the year that previously 
reduced the capital cost and described under 
paragraph 13(7.1)(d) 
The cost of acquisitions generally means the full cost of 
acquiring the property, including legal, accounting, 
engineering, and other fees. Land is not a depreciable 
property, and is therefore not eligible for CCA. List any 
acquisitions that are not subject to the 50% rule, separately. 
See Regulations 1100(2) and (2.2) for more information 
about these types of acquisitions. Do not enter section 85 
transfers in this column. 
Note 
A corporation that receives an amount of 
non-government assistance to buy depreciable property 
has the option of either reducing the capital cost of the 
property by this amount, or including the assistance in 
its income.

In some cases, you will have to adjust the UCC of a 
property. In column 5, enter the amounts that will either 
reduce or increase the UCC. 
Reduce the UCC of a property by the following amounts: 
■ any amount by which the UCC for the class is required 
(otherwise than because of a reduction in the taxpayer’s 
capital cost of depreciable property) to be reduced at or 
before the time of the UCC calculation because of the 
debt forgiveness rules in subsection 80(5) 
■ each amount of ITC allowed on a property for a tax year 
which has ended before the UCC calculation and after 
disposition of the property 
■ each amount of assistance you received (or were entitled 
to receive) after the disposition of a property, if such 
assistance would have decreased the capital cost of the 
property by virtue of paragraph 13(7.1)(f) 
■ each amount you received after February 23, 1998, and 
before the time of the UCC calculation for a refund of an 
amount as or on account of a proposed or existing 
countervailing or anti-dumping duty on a particular 
property added to the UCC of the class 
Add to the UCC of the property: 
■ any legally required repayment of assistance made after 
the disposition of a particular property, that would have 
otherwise increased the capital cost of the property 
under paragraph 13(7.1)(d) 
■ any legally required repayment of an inducement, 
assistance or any other amount contemplated in 
paragraph 12(1)(x) received after the disposition of a 
particular property, that otherwise would have increased 
the capital cost of the property under 
paragraph 13(7.4)(b) 
■ each amount payable after February 23, 1998, and paid 
before the time of the UCC calculation as or on account 
of a proposed or existing countervailing or anti-dumping 
duty on a particular property 
Also include in column 5 depreciable property transferred 
on amalgamation or upon the wind-up of a subsidiary, and

capital cost of the property under paragraph 13(7.1)(d) 
■ an inducement, assistance or any other amount 
contemplated in paragraph 12(1)(x) received, that 
otherwise would have increased the capital cost of the 
property under paragraph 13(7.4)(b) 
These amounts are included in column 5 as they increase 
the capital cost of a property. They are also reported 
separately in column 7.

Column 8 – Proceeds of dispositions 
For each class, you usually enter the total proceeds of 
disposition received or are entitled to be received for 
property disposed of during the year. However, if you 
disposed of the property for more than its capital cost, enter 
the capital cost, not the actual proceeds of disposition. 
A capital gain results when you dispose of a depreciable 
property for more than its capital cost. However, losses on 
depreciable property do not result in capital losses. They 
may result in terminal losses. For details about terminal 
losses, see column 22. 
Column 9 – Proceeds of disposition of the DIEP 
For any applicable DIEP reported in column 4, enter the 
total proceeds of disposition if you disposed of it during the 
year. They are included in column 8 and shown separately 
in column 9. 
Column 10 – UCC 
To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 10, do 
the following: 
■ add the amounts in columns 2 and 3 
■ either subtract or add the amount in column 5 (subtract if 
it is a negative amount, or add if it is a positive amount) 
■ subtract the amount in column 8 
You cannot claim CCA in the following situations: 
■ the amount in column 10 is positive, and no property is 
left in that class at the end of the tax year (a terminal 
loss) 
■ the amount in column 10 is negative (a recapture of 
CCA) 
Terminal loss 
A terminal loss results when you dispose of all the 
property in a particular class and there is an amount of 
undepreciated capital cost left in column 10. You have to 
deduct the terminal loss from income. If applicable, enter 
the positive amount from column 10 in column 22. For 
details, see example 1 under the heading “Schedule 8 
examples” that follows. 
Recapture of CCA 
If the amount in column 10 is negative, you have a 
recapture of CCA. A recapture of CCA occurs when the 
proceeds of disposition in column 8 are more than the total 
of columns 2 and 3, plus or minus the amount in column 5 
of that class. 
You have to add the recapture to income. If applicable, 
enter the negative amount from column 10 in column 21 as 
a positive. For details, see example 2 under the heading 
“Schedule 8 examples” that follows. 
The recapture and terminal loss rules do not apply to 
passenger vehicles in class 10.1. However, the recapture 
rules do apply to a passenger vehicle that was, at any time, 
a DIEP. 
Once you have entered the recapture or terminal loss from 
column 10 in column 21 or 22, do not complete columns 23 
and 24 for that line. 
Column 11 – UCC of the DIEP 
Enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in 
column 4. That amount should not exceed the UCC amount 
reported in column 10. 
Column 12 – Immediate expensing 
The immediate expensing for CCPCs is the lesser of the 
following two amounts: 
■ the immediate expensing limit for the tax year 
■ the UCC of the DIEP for the tax year (amount from 
column 11) 
The immediate expensing limit is equal to one of the 
following five amounts, whichever is applicable: 
■ $1.5 million, if the CCPC is not associated (under 
subsection 1104(3.6) of the Regulations) with any 
other EPOP in the tax year 
■ the immediate expensing limit allocated to the CCPC in 
Part 1 of Schedule 8, if the CCPC is associated with one 
or more EPOPs in the tax year and you entered into an 
agreement with them under subsection 1104(3.3) of the 
Regulations 
■ nil, if the CCPC is associated with one or more EPOPs in 
the tax year and: 
– the total of the percentages assigned in the agreement 
is more than 100% or 
– the CCPC has not filed an agreement in prescribed 
form as required under subsection 1104(3.3) of the 
Regulations 
■ the amount determined under subsection 1104(3.5) of the 
Regulations for any second or subsequent tax years 
ending in a calendar year, if the CCPC has two or more 
tax years ending in the calendar year in which it is 
associated with another EPOP that has a tax year ending 
in that calendar year 
■ any amount allocated by the minister under 
subsection 1104(3.4) of the Regulations

Column 13 – Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class 
Column 13 represents the cost of acquisitions that are not 
eligible for the immediate expensing incentive. This 
includes properties that are not DIEP or are DIEPs that 
have exceeded the immediate expensing deduction for the 
tax year. 
To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 13, do 
the following: 
■ add the amount in column 3 
■ subtract the amount in column 12 
Column 14 – Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are 
accelerated investment incentive property (AIIP) or 
properties included in classes 54 to 56 
For each class, enter the total cost of the AIIP or properties 
included in classes 54 to 56 that you acquired during the 
year. They are included in column 13 and shown separately 
in column 14. 
AIIP generally means a property, other than property 
included in classes 54 to 56, acquired after 
November 20, 2018, and that becomes available for use 
before 2028. 
For more details, see “Zero-emission vehicles –Classes 54 
and 55”, on page 46, “Zero-emission vehicles – Class 56”, 
on page 47, and “Accelerated investment incentive 
property”, on page 48.

Column 15 – Remaining UCC 
Column 15 represents the remaining portion of UCC after 
applying the immediate expensing deduction. The 
remaining portion of UCC will be used to calculate the 
CCA deduction under subsection 1100(1) of the 
Regulations. 
Subtract the amount in column 12 from the amount in 
column 10 and enter the difference. 
Reference 
Regulation 1100(0.2) 
Column 16 – Proceeds of disposition available to reduce 
the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 
When you purchase an AIIP or a property included in 
classes 54 to 56 and a property other than an AIIP and 
property included in classes 54 to 56 during the year and a 
disposition occurs, the disposition first offsets the property 
other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56. 
Then it reduces the undepreciated capital cost of the AIIP 
or the property included in classes 54 to 56. 
To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 16, do 
the following: 
■ add the amount in column 8 
■ add the amount in column 6 
■ subtract the amount in column 13 
■ add the amount in column 14 
■ subtract the amount in column 7 
Reference 
Regulation 1100(2) 
Column 17 – Net capital cost additions of AIIP and 
property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the 
year 
Subtract the amount in column 16 from the amount in 
column 14 and enter the difference. 
Reference 
Regulation 1100(2) 
Column 18 – UCC adjustment for AIIP and property 
included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year 
You must adjust the remaining UCC (from column 15) to 
include an accelerated CCA component for accelerated 
investment incentive property and any property included 
in classes 54 to 56 that you acquired during the year. 
Multiply the net capital cost of additions from column 17 
by 0.5 unless a different factor is provided in the legislation. 
Reference 
Regulation 1100(2) 
Column 19 – UCC adjustment for property acquired during 
the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 
54 to 56 (previously known as the 50% rule) 
Generally, property acquired during the tax year was only 
eligible for 50% of the normal maximum CCA for the year. 
You could claim full CCA for that property in the next tax 
year. 
This 50% rule does not apply to certain property, including 
AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56. 
To apply the 50% rule, the remaining UCC of the property 
(from column 15) has to be adjusted. This adjustment is 
equal to half of the net amount of additions to the class (the 
net cost of acquisitions minus the proceeds of dispositions). 
Enter this amount in column 19. For details, see example 3 
under the heading “Schedule 8 examples” that follows. 
When applying the 50% rule, do not reduce the net amount 
of additions by the ITC claimed in the previous tax year 
and included in column 5. 
Certain properties acquired through non-arm’s-length 
transfers or butterfly transfers (which occur in the course of 
certain reorganizations) are exempt from the 50% rule. 
The AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 are also 
exempt from the 50% rule. For special rules and exceptions, 
see Income Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital 
Cost Allowance. 
To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 19, do 
the following: 
■ subtract the amount in column 14 from the amount in 
column 13 
■ subtract the amount in column 6 
■ add the amount in column 7 
■ subtract the amount in column 8

Regulations 1100(2) and 1100(2.2) 
Column 20 – CCA rate 
Enter the prescribed rate that applies, as provided for 
under Part XI of the Regulations. If a specific rate has not 
been provided for a particular class of property, enter N/A 
in this column. 
Enter a rate only if you are using the declining balance 
method. In this method, the CCA is calculated by 
multiplying a constant rate by the diminishing balance 
every year. 
Note 
Some asset classes use the straight-line method to 
calculate the CCA. In this method, the CCA is calculated 
by dividing the original amount by the number of years 
that corresponds to the life expectancy of the property. 
Therefore, the deducted amount stays the same from one 
year to the other (except the first and last year, if the 
half-year rule applies for property acquired before 
November 21, 2018) and you do not have to enter a rate. 
Example 
Declining balance method – The capital cost of an asset 
other than an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, 
or a property to which the immediate expensing was 
applied, is $780,000. The rate for the class is 10% with a 
half-year rule. 
First year:  
10% × $780,000 = $78,000  
$78,000 ÷ 2 = $39,000 CCA (half-year rule) 
Second year:  
$780,000 – $39,000 = $741,000 (undepreciated capital cost) 
$741,000 × 10% = $74,100 CCA 
Third year: 
$741,000 – $74,100 = $666,900 (undepreciated capital cost) 
$666,900 × 10% = $66,690 CCA 
And so on for the following years. 
Straight-line method – The capital cost of an asset other 
than an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, or a 
property to which the immediate expensing was applied, is 
$780,000. The asset’s life expectancy is 10 years and the 
half-year rule does not apply. Therefore, the capital cost 
allowance will be $78,000 per year ($780,000 ÷ 10). 
 
Class 13 (property that is a leasehold interest) uses the 
straight-line method (with the half-year rule for property 
acquired before November 21, 2018). 
An accelerated investment incentive applies to class 13 for 
property acquired after November 20, 2018. See Accelerated 
investment incentive property on page 48. 
If a disposition of all leasehold interests in class 13 occurs 
during the amortization period, the terminal loss is claimed 
in the year it occurs if the lessee does not acquire a 
depreciable property that is a leasehold interest before the 
end of the year. 
For more information on the half-year rule, see Income Tax 
Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance. 
Column 21 – Recapture of CCA 
Enter the amount of recapture from column 10, if 
applicable. Be sure you include the recapture as income. 
Enter the total of amounts from column 21 on line 107 of 
Schedule 1. 
The recapture rules do not apply to passenger vehicles in 
class 10.1. However, recapture does apply to a passenger 
vehicle that was, at any time, a DIEP.

Subsections 13(1) and 13(2) 
Column 22 – Terminal loss 
Enter the terminal loss from column 10, if applicable. 
Deduct the terminal loss from income. Enter the total of 
amounts from column 22 on line 404 of Schedule 1. 
The terminal loss rules do not apply to: 
■ passenger vehicles in class 10.1 
■ property in class 14.1, unless you have stopped carrying 
on the business to which it relates 
■ limited-period franchises, concessions, or licences in 
class 14 if, at the time of acquisition, the property was a 
former property of the transferor or any similar property 
attributable to the same fixed place of business, and you 
had jointly elected with the transferor to have the 
replacement property rules apply, unless certain 
conditions are met 
Reference 
Subsection 20(16.1) 
Column 23 – CCA 
To claim the maximum CCA for each class, for the 
declining balance method, do the following calculation: 
■ add the amount in column 15 and the amount in 
column 18 
■ subtract the amount in column 19 
■ multiply the result by the rate in column 20 
■ add the amount in column 12 
Enter the result in column 23. You do not have to claim the 
maximum allowable CCA. You can claim any amount up to 
the maximum. 
If the tax year is less than 365 days, prorate the CCA claim 
for all property except for those classes of property that 
Regulation 1100(3) excludes. The exceptions in 
Regulation 1100(3) include: 
■ class 14 assets 
■ class 15 assets 
■ timber limits and cutting rights 
■ industrial mineral mines 
■ certified productions 
■ Canadian film or video productions 
■ certain mining equipment in classes 28 and 41

To determine the maximum CCA claim, multiply the 
maximum CCA for a complete year by the number of days 
in the tax year divided by 365.

The total of all amounts in column 23 is the CCA claim for 
the tax year. Deduct this amount on line 403 of Schedule 1. 
Notes 
If you want to change the amount of CCA claimed in a 
tax year, send a written request within 90 days of the 
date on the notice of assessment or notice of 
reassessment. Only under certain circumstances can the 
CRA make adjustments after the 90-day period has 
expired. 
For more information, see Information Circular IC84-1, 
Revision of Capital Cost Allowance Claims and Other 
Permissive Deductions. 
Column 24 – UCC at the end of the year 
Subtract the amount in column 23 from the amount in 
column 10 and enter the difference. When there is a 
recapture of CCA or a terminal loss for a particular class in 
the year, the undepreciated capital cost at the end of the 
year is always nil.

Example 2: Recapture of CCA 
A clothing company bought a sewing machine on February 1, 2021, for $15,000. The machine qualified for the accelerated 
investment incentive. Now, because of the company’s overwhelming success in the retail end of the business, it has decided 
to concentrate solely on retailing. As a result, the company sold its sewing machine in 2024 for $18,000 (but the proceeds of 
disposition in column 8 cannot be more than $15,000, the capital cost). At the beginning of 2024, the undepreciated capital 
cost of the sewing machine was $6,720.

In the 2024 tax year, a bookstore bought a photocopier for $10,000 to help keep up with the paperwork, and started using it 
right away. The vendor was a non-arm’s length person who has claimed CCA for the photocopier in a prior tax year. The 
photocopier is then not considered AIIP. The bookstore has to apply the 50% rule when it calculates the amount of CCA it 
can deduct for its tax year ending in 2024. 
The bookstore’s Schedule 8 for its 2024 tax year looks like this:

Example 4: Accelerated investment incentive property 
A grocery store bought refrigeration equipment to store fruits and vegetables for $20,000 during its 2021 tax year and before 
April 19, 2021. 
All properties bought during the tax year qualify for the accelerated investment incentive and are referred to as AIIP. They 
are included in columns 3 and 13, and reported separately in column 14. 
The amount of AIIP subject to the CCA deduction is $20,000 plus an additional relevant factor of 50% (calculated in 
column 18) for a total amount of $30,000. AIIP are also not subject to the half-year rule. 
Without the accelerated investment incentive, the amount of property bought during the tax year subject to the CCA 
deduction would be $10,000 as the half-year rule would apply. 
The accelerated investment incentive allows the grocery store to claim up to three times the amount of CCA otherwise 
deductible in the first year.

Example 5: AIIP and non-AIIP 
A potato producer bought tractors for $200,000 during its 2021 tax year and before April 19, 2021. The purchase includes 
tractors for $50,000 that do not qualify for the accelerated investment incentive because the producer bought them from a 
non-arm’s length person who has claimed CCA for them. 
Properties that qualify for the accelerated investment incentive are referred to as AIIP and equal to $150,000. They are 
included in column 13 and reported separately in column 14. 
The amount of AIIP subject to the CCA deduction is $150,000, plus an additional relevant factor of 50% (calculated in 
column 18) for a total amount of $225,000. AIIP is not subject to the half-year rule. 
Properties bought during the year that are not AIIP ($50,000, which is the difference between columns 13 and 14) are not 
eligible for any enhancement from column 18 and are subject to the half-year rule calculation in column 19.

Example 6: Designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) 
A new corporation that is a CCPC decides to start manufacturing cars. On May 1, 2023, it bought eligible machinery and 
equipment for $1.2 million. The corporation is not associated with any other eligible person or partnership (EPOP) during 
the tax year. 
All properties bought during the tax year qualify for the immediate expensing incentive and are referred to as DIEP. Those 
properties are included in column 3 and reported separately in column 4. 
The amount of immediate expensing allowed is the lesser of the immediate expensing limit ($1.5 million) and the UCC of 
the DIEP ($1.2 million) for $1.2 million. DIEPs are also not subject to the half-year rule. 
In this scenario, the immediate expensing incentive allows the corporation to write off the full cost of the asset in the first 
year. 
The company’s Schedule 8 for its 2023 tax year looks like this:

Example 7: DIEP and non-DIEP 
A corporation with a tax year starting on July 1, 2023, and ending on June 30, 2024, purchased eligible machinery and 
equipment on July 1, 2023, for $1 million and July 15, 2023, for $1.8 million. Properties purchased on July 1, 2023, became 
available for use on February 1, 2024, while properties purchased on July 15, 2023, became available for use on the purchase 
date. All properties qualify for the accelerated investment incentive. The corporation is not associated with any other 
eligible person or partnership (EPOP) during the tax year. 
DIEPs are properties the corporation acquires after April 18, 2021, that become available for use before 2024. Therefore, the 
total cost of DIEPs would be $1.8 million. Those properties are included in column 3 and reported separately in column 4. 
The amount of immediate expensing allowed is the lesser of the immediate expensing limit ($1.5 million) and the UCC 
of the DIEP ($1.8 million) for $1.5 million. The remaining $1.3 million, which is made of property not eligible for the DIEP 
designation (the asset purchased on July 1, 2023, for $1 million) and the remaining portion of the DIEP not eligible for the 
immediate expensing ($300,000, which is the difference between the UCC of the DIEP of $1.8 million and the $1.5 million 
immediate expensing), is eligible for the accelerated investment incentive. 
The amount of AIIP subject to the CCA deduction is $1.3 million plus an additional relevant factor of 50% (calculated in 
column 18) for a total amount of $1,950,000, on which the CCA rate of 30% is applied for a result of $585,000. The immediate 
expensing of $1.5 million is added to that amount to get a total CCA deduction of $2,085,000 in column 23. 
The corporation’s schedule 8 on June 30, 2024, would look like this:

Schedule 12, Resource-Related Deductions 
You have to complete the appropriate parts of Schedule 12 
if you are claiming any of the following deductions on 
Schedule 1: 
■ Canadian exploration expenses, including Canadian 
renewable and conservation expense (CRCE) 
■ Canadian development expenses 
■ Canadian oil and gas property expenses 
■ depletion 
■ foreign exploration and development expenses 
■ specified foreign exploration and development expenses 
■ foreign resource expenses 
An accelerated investment incentive is available for eligible 
Canadian development expenses (CDE) and Canadian oil 
and gas property expenses (COGPE) incurred after 
November 20, 2018, and before 2028. The accelerated CDE 
or COGPE does not include expenses incurred by a 
predecessor corporation that a successor corporation is 
entitled to claim. It also does not include an expense that is 
a cost for Canadian resource property you, or a partnership 
in which you are a member, acquired from a person or 
partnership with which you do not deal at arm’s length. 
The incentive will be phased out for expenses made 
after 2023. For more information, go to canada.ca/taxes 
-accelerated-investment-income. 
Canadian exploration expenses and Canadian 
development expenses 
Note 
Eligible expenses related to lithium from brines made on 
or after March 28, 2023, qualify as Canadian exploration 
expenses and Canadian development expenses. 
Canadian renewable and conservation expense 
If most of the tangible property in a project is eligible for 
inclusion in class 43.1 or 43.2, certain intangible project 
start-up expenses (for example, engineering and design 
work, and feasibility studies) are treated as Canadian 
renewable and conservation expenses. You can generally 
deduct these expenses in full in the year you incurred them, 
carry them forward indefinitely for use in future years, or 
transfer them to investors using flow-through shares. 
Schedule 12 gives details for the calculations required. 
Flow-through shares 
Note 
The flow-through share regime is eliminated for oil, gas, 
and coal activities. This means you can no longer 
renounce oil, gas and coal exploration or development 
expenditures to a flow-through share investor. This 
applies to expenditures under flow-through share 
agreements entered into after March 31, 2023. 
The Fall Economic Statement 2018 introduced an 
accelerated rate for Canadian development expenses (CDE) 
that a flow-through share (FTS) investor receives from a 
principal business corporation. This tax measure applies to 
accelerated CDE renounced under FTS agreements entered 
into after November 20, 2018, for CDE incurred after the 
agreement date and before 2028. 
A principal business corporation needs to inform the 
investor that the renounced amount meets the above 
conditions in order for the investor to benefit from the 
permissive accelerated rate for these renounced expenses. 
If you have invested in an FTS after November 20, 2018, 
and have received a statement of resource expenses from a 
principal business corporation, you may generally 
claim CDE at the rate of 45% in the tax year in which they 
are renounced to you and, thereafter, at a rate of 30%. To 
calculate the amount of the CDE deduction you are entitled 
to claim, see Schedule 12.

Part XII of the Regulations 
Sections 65 and 66 
Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves 
You have to complete Schedule 13 to show the continuity 
of deductible reserves. Indicate, on the appropriate lines, 
the prior-year and the current-year reserves as well as the 
reserve transferred from an amalgamation or wind-up. If 
your corporation or the predecessor corporation deducted a 
reserve amount last year, add that amount to current-year 
income and establish a new reserve amount. 
Complete Schedule 13 as follows: 
Part 1 – Capital gains reserves 
Establish the continuity of reserves for each different 
property. Unlike other reserves, you have to report the total 
capital gain reserves that you and the predecessor 
corporation deducted last year. Add the current-year 
reserve on Schedule 6 to calculate the current-year capital 
gain. See page 42 for more details. 
Part 2 – Other reserves 
In this part, establish the continuity of the following 
reserves: 
■ reserve for doubtful debts 
■ reserve for undelivered goods and services not rendered 
(except for reclamation obligations) 
■ reserve for prepaid rent 
■ reserve for returnable containers 
■ reserve for unpaid amounts 
■ other tax reserves 
Enter, on line 125 of Schedule 1, the total of the balance of 
your reserve at the beginning of the year (line 270 of 
Schedule 13) plus the amount of reserve transferred on 
wind-up/amalgamation (line 275 of Schedule 13). 
Enter, on line 413 of Schedule 1, the balance at the end of 
the year (line 280 of Schedule 13). 
Note 
The balance at the beginning of the year of reserves from 
financial statements and the balance at the end of the 
year of reserves from financial statements should not be

Schedule 16, Patronage Dividend Deduction 
Complete Schedule 16 if you are claiming a patronage 
dividend deduction. This deduction is for payments made 
to customers for allocations in proportion to patronage. An 
allocation in proportion to patronage entitles a customer to 
receive payment calculated at a rate relating to the quantity, 
quality, or value of either goods or products sold or 
services rendered. 
Corporations have to pay amounts that qualify for this 
deduction either during the tax year, or in the 12 months 
that follow the tax year. 
An agricultural cooperative corporation for a particular tax 
year can deduct patronage dividends issued in the form of 
tax deferred cooperative shares, but deductions cannot be 
more than 85% of its income for that year that is 
attributable to business done with its members. 
Corporations other than credit unions and cooperative 
corporations cannot deduct patronage dividends paid to 
non-arm’s length persons. 
Parts 1, 2, and 3 of Schedule 16 give details on how to 
calculate the allowable patronage dividend deduction. 
Enter this deduction on line 416 of Schedule 1. 
If you are claiming a patronage dividend deduction, you 
also have to complete Part 5 of Schedule 16 entitled 
“Calculation of income from an active business carried on 
in Canada (ABI).” Enter the amount from line 124 at 
line 400 of the return. 
File a completed copy of this schedule with your return. 
Note 
Eligible members of agricultural cooperative 
corporations can defer including in income patronage 
dividends in the form of tax deferred cooperative shares 
issued before 2026 to the year of their disposal. 
However, a member may elect to have an amount 
included in income before the disposition of the shares. 
To make this election, the member must send a letter 
specifying the amount to be included in income with 
their return for the particular tax year.

Schedule 17, Credit Union Deductions 
As a credit union, you may deduct bonus interest payments 
and payments for allocations in proportion to borrowing. If 
so, complete Schedule 17. 
Note 
Ontario and British Columbia provide a provincial tax 
reduction for credit unions. For details, see the 
provinces’ specific sections on pages 110 and 126 
respectively. 
A credit union can deduct from its income for a tax year 
both the total of all bonus interest payments and the 
payments it made in the year to its members for allocations 
in proportion to borrowing. It can also deduct payments 
made in the 12 months after the end of the tax year. 
However, the credit union cannot deduct an amount if it 
could have deducted it in the previous tax year. 
The allocation in proportion to borrowing for a tax year 
means an amount a credit union credits to a member that is 
entitled to, or will receive, this amount. 
On Schedule 17, you have to calculate the payment made 
for allocations in proportion to borrowing at a rate that is 
related to one of the following: 
■ the amount of interest payable by the member on money 
the member borrowed from the credit union 
■ the amount of money the member borrowed from the 
credit union 
You have to calculate the bonus interest payment at a rate 
that is related to one of the following: 
■ the interest payable by the credit union on money 
standing to the member’s credit 
■ the amount of money standing to the member’s credit 
The amount the credit union credited to the member has to 
bear the same rate as the interest or money that the credit 
union similarly credited to all other members of the credit 
union of the same class. 
Complete the appropriate parts of Schedule 17 to calculate 
this deduction. Add lines 305 and 315 of Schedule 17 and 
enter the result on line 315 of Schedule 1.

Expenditures Claim 
The CRA publishes Guide T4088, Scientific Research and 
Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim – 
Guide to Form T661, which gives details on how to complete 
Form T661. For more information, go  
to canada.ca/taxes-sred. 
File Form T661 if you carry on business in Canada and have 
incurred expenditures for scientific research and 
experimental development (SR&ED) you carried on in 
Canada and for some salary or wage expenditures 
for SR&ED carried on outside Canada. 
To avoid delays in processing, use the most recent version 
of Form T661. 
A corporation has to file Form T661 to identify an 
expenditure and the SR&ED work to support its 
characterization as an SR&ED expenditure, as well as any 
claim preparer information. 
If the corporation does not provide, in this way, the 
information about the expenditure, it cannot characterize 
the amount as an SR&ED expenditure.

If the corporation does not provide complete and accurate 
claim preparer information, a $1,000 penalty applies. 
However, the SR&ED claim will not be disallowed for this 
reason. When an SR&ED claim preparer participates in 
preparing a claim, the corporation and the SR&ED claim 
preparer are liable, together or separately, for the 
$1,000 penalty. 
SR&ED expenditures, plus or minus adjustments, form a 
pool that you can deduct in the current year to calculate the 
net income for tax purposes or that you can carry forward 
and deduct in any future year. 
If the SR&ED expenditures have been included in your 
income statement, enter the amount on line 118 of 
Schedule 1. Enter the SR&ED expenditures claimed in the 
year on line 411 of Schedule 1. 
Form T661 summarizes the costs for all SR&ED projects. 
File it whether or not you claim an ITC. If you do not file 
Form T661 and Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – 
Corporations, on or before the day that is 12 months after the 
filing due date of your income tax return for the tax year in 
which the SR&ED expenditures were made, you cannot 
claim SR&ED expenditures and earn an SR&ED ITC for 
that year. For more information, see “Lines 652 and 780 – 
Investment tax credits” on page 88. 
A non-profit corporation for SR&ED (see “Box 2 – Exempt 
under paragraph 149(1)(j)”, on page 29) has to file 
Form T661 on or before the filing due date for the tax year 
to avoid a late-filing penalty. 
When a corporation is a member of a partnership that 
incurs SR&ED expenditures, the partnership, and not the 
members of the partnership, has to file Form T661 along 
with the T5013 FIN, Partnership Financial Return, and 
T5013 SUM, Information Slips Summary. Each member that 
receives an information slip T5013, Statement of Partnership 
Income, showing its share of the expenditures, does not 
have to file it with its return. They should keep it in case the 
CRA asks for it later.

Losses 
Current-year losses 
A corporation may not always have net income to report. 
Instead, it may have incurred a loss for the year. The 
different types of losses a corporation can incur are: 
■ non-capital loss 
■ farm loss 
■ restricted farm loss 
■ limited partnership loss 
■ capital loss 
The application and continuity of the first four losses are 
calculated on Schedule 4, Corporation Loss Continuity and 
Application. Information on how to complete Schedule 4 
follows this section. 
Capital losses are determined on Schedule 6, Summary of 
Dispositions of Capital Property. For information on how to 
complete this schedule, see page 42. 
Applying losses 
A corporation can apply unused losses and deduct them 
from income it earned in the current tax year or in previous 
tax years. 
Note 
You can choose whether or not to deduct an available 
loss from income in a tax year. You can deduct losses in 
any order. However, for each type of loss, make sure to 
deduct the oldest available loss first. 
You can view non-capital loss balances using the “View 
return balances” service through: 
■ My Business Account, at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are the business owner 
■ Represent a Client, at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
Losses carryback 
You can use losses in any order, but consider the following: 
■ a current-year non-capital loss or farm loss can reduce 
any kind of income or taxable dividends subject to 
Part IV tax for the three previous years 
■ a net capital loss can reduce taxable capital gains 
included in your income for the three previous years 
■ a restricted farm loss can reduce farming income for the 
three previous years 
■ a listed personal property loss can reduce capital gains 
incurred on listed personal property for the 
three previous years 
Except for net capital losses, you cannot use other year 
losses to create or increase a non-capital loss for the tax 
year. 
Use Schedule 4 to request the carryback of any losses to 
prior years. If you do not attach your request to the return, 
you can send it separately to your tax centre. 
Calculating losses when there is an 
acquisition of control 
Following an acquisition of control, special rules apply for 
calculating and deducting net capital losses, non-capital 
losses, and farm losses. You will find more information 
about these rules on Schedule 4 and at lines 063 and 065 on 
page 27. Also, see the following references for details.

Current-year farm loss 
The current-year farm loss is whichever of the following 
amounts is less: 
■ the loss from farming or fishing that is more than the 
farming or fishing income for the year 
■ the amount of the current-year non-capital loss as 
calculated in Part 1 of Schedule 4 before you deduct the 
farm loss for the year 
Enter the farm loss calculated on line 310 of Schedule 4. 
The farm loss can also include an amount allocated from a 
partnership. 
If the result after the calculation shown under Part 1 is 
negative, enter this result (as positive) on line 110 of 
Schedule 4 as the current-year non-capital loss. 
Note 
You cannot use prior-year losses to create or increase a 
current-year non-capital loss, except with net capital 
losses of other years.

IT-302, Losses of a Corporation – The Effect That Acquisitions of Control, 
Amalgamations and Windings-Up Have on Their Deductibility – 
After January 15, 1987 
Continuity of non-capital losses and request for a 
carryback 
Use this area to establish the continuity of non-capital 
losses and to carry back a current-year non-capital loss to 
prior years. 
The current-year non-capital loss can reduce any kind of 
income or taxable dividends subject to Part IV tax for the 
20 following tax years and for the 3 previous tax years. The 
loss expires after the carry-forward period. 
When completing this part, line 105 is the amount of 
non-capital losses transferred from a predecessor 
corporation after amalgamation or a subsidiary after 
wind-up where not less than 90% of the issued shares in 
each class were, immediately before the wind-up, owned 
by the corporation. This amount is the unused non-capital 
losses available to be carried forward at the end of the tax 
year of the predecessor corporation or subsidiary ending 
immediately before the amalgamation or wind-up, minus 
any expired amount. 
Line 150 is an amount received under subsection 111(10) as 
a fuel tax rebate that reduced non-capital loss for a previous 
year, and any other adjustments not previously mentioned. 
These adjustments would apply to corporations that have 
undergone an acquisition of control and whose losses that 
accrued before the acquisition of control are not deductible 
after the acquisition of control. 
Line 140 is the amount of debt forgiveness under section 80 
that reduces the non-capital losses balance. Losses have to 
be reduced in the order established by section 80. 
The result of this part is the closing balance of non-capital 
losses you carry forward to future years (line 180). 
Complete Part 6 to establish the balance of non-capital 
losses by year of origin. 
Part 2 – Capital losses 
Continuity of capital losses and request for a carryback 
The current-year capital loss is calculated on Schedule 6. 
See page 42 for more details. Complete this part to establish 
the continuity and the application of capital losses. 
To establish the continuity, you have to enter the amount of 
capital losses and not the amount of net capital losses 
available. The inclusion rate will be used only when the 
loss is applied. You have to indicate the balance of any 
previous-year capital losses carried forward. 
The net capital loss can reduce taxable capital gains 
included as income for the three previous tax years and 
indefinitely for future years.

amalgamation or a subsidiary after wind-up where not less 
than 90% of the issued shares of each class were, 
immediately before the wind-up, owned by the 
corporation. This amount is the unused capital losses 
available to carry forward at the end of the tax year of the 
predecessor corporation or subsidiary ending immediately 
before the amalgamation or wind-up, including any 
amount of the allowable business investment loss (ABIL) 
expired as non-capital loss for the predecessor corporation 
or the subsidiary, divided by the inclusion rate for the tax 
year in which the ABIL was incurred. 
Line 250 is the amount of any other adjustments not 
previously mentioned. These adjustments would apply to 
corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control 
and whose losses that accrued before the acquisition of 
control are not deductible after the acquisition of control. 
These adjustments would also apply to corporations whose 
losses that occurred after the acquisition of control are not 
deductible before the acquisition of control. 
Line 240 is the amount of debt forgiveness under section 80 
that reduces the capital losses balance. Losses have to be 
reduced in the order established by section 80. 
Line 220 is the amount of ABIL earned as non-capital losses 
in the 11th previous year that has not been used against 
taxable income in the previous 10 years, multiplied by 2. 
On the appropriate line (lines 951 to 953), enter the amount 
of capital loss you carry back to prior years. 
The result of this part is the closing balance of available 
capital losses you carry forward to future years (line 280). 
The net capital loss amount will be calculated at the 50% 
inclusion rate. 
Part 3 – Farm losses 
Continuity of farm losses and request for a carryback 
Use this part to establish the continuity of farm losses and 
to carry back a current-year farm loss to previous years. 
Farm losses include losses from farming and fishing 
businesses. 
Farm losses will expire after 20 tax years following the year 
of the loss. 
When completing this part, line 305 is the amount of farm 
losses transferred from a predecessor corporation after 
amalgamation or subsidiary after wind-up where not less 
than 90% of the issued shares in each class were, 
immediately before the wind-up, owned by the 
corporation. This amount is the unused farm losses 
available to carry forward at the end of the tax year of the 
predecessor corporation or subsidiary ending immediately 
before the amalgamation or wind-up minus any expired 
amount.

Part 4 – Restricted farm losses 
Current-year restricted farm loss 
If your chief source of income is neither farming nor a 
combination of farming and some other subordinate source 
of income, the loss arising from the farming activity that 
you can deduct is restricted. An amount of farm loss 
allocated from a partnership may also be restricted. 
The limit of deductible farm losses for a year is $17,500.

of origin 
Use this part to show by year of origin the balance of losses 
you can carry forward to future years. Enter each loss by 
year of origin, starting with the current year and going 
down to the 20th previous year. 
Part 7 – Limited partnership losses 
Current-year limited partnership losses 
Use this part to calculate the current-year limited 
partnership losses that cannot be deducted in the year, but 
can be carried forward to other years. 
The amount of partnership loss allocated to a limited 
partner is reported on an information slip T5013, Statement 
of Partnership Income. If the limited partner does not 
receive this slip because the partnership is exempt from 
filing, you have to file the partnership’s financial 
statements with the return to prove the corporation’s 
share of the partnership loss for the year. 
Report the amount in the corporation’s tax year that the 
partnership’s fiscal period ends in. 
The part of a partnership loss that a limited partner can 
deduct in determining net income for income tax purposes 
may be restricted. 
For tax years that end after February 26, 2018, it was 
clarified that the at-risk rules apply to a partnership that is 
itself a limited partner of another partnership and that a 
corporation’s available non-capital loss and limited 
partnership loss carry forward balances have to be adjusted 
as if these rules applied in the preceding years. 
In column 606, enter the corporation’s at-risk amount at the 
fiscal period ending of the partnership (column 602). The 
amount entered in column 604 is from a business (other 
than a farming or fishing business) or from property. 
In general terms, you have to calculate a limited partner’s 
at-risk amount as follows: 
the adjusted cost base of its partnership interest 
plus 
its share of the current-year’s income from the 
partnership 
minus 
all amounts the partner owes to the partnership, and 
any amount or benefit to which the partner is entitled 
that is intended to protect it from the loss of its 
investment 
In general, interests in partnerships that were operating on 
a regular and continuous basis on February 25, 1986, and 
continuously thereafter, are exempt from the at-risk rules. 
However, partnership interests may lose their exempt 
status if, after February 25, 1986, there has been either a 
substantial contribution of capital to the partnership or 
substantial partnership borrowings. 
The difference between the corporation’s share of the actual 
loss of the partnership and the corporation’s at-risk amount 
(reduced by any investment tax credit, clean economy tax 
credit, farming losses and resource expenses the 
partnership allocated to the corporation for that fiscal 
period) is called a limited partnership loss. This amount is 
entered in column 620. 
Add the total of column 620 to line 222 of Schedule 1. Enter 
all those losses in column 670 to establish the continuity of 
losses.

Taxable income 
The following section explains how to calculate the 
deductions you may be able to claim to reduce net income. 
You will use these amounts to arrive at your taxable 
income. 
Line 300 – Net income or (loss) for income tax 
purposes 
On line 300, enter the net income or loss for income tax 
purposes, as you calculated on Schedule 1. If you did not 
have to make any adjustments to the net income or loss 
from the financial statements or the General Index of 
Financial Information (GIFI), enter on line 300 the net 
income or loss from the income statement. Show the 
amount of any loss in brackets. 
Note 
On Schedule 1, do not deduct charitable donations, 
taxable dividends, net capital losses, non-capital losses, 
farm losses, or restricted farm losses from other years. 
You have to deduct these items from net income for 
income tax purposes to arrive at taxable income. 
Lines 311 to 314 
The deadline for making donations eligible for tax support 
in the 2024 tax year is proposed to be extended until 
February 28, 2025. 
Gifts made before March 2025 are deemed to have been 
made in a tax year of a corporation that ends after 
November 14, 2024, and before 2025 (the "donation year"), 
and not in the corporation’s 2025 tax year, if all of the 
following apply: 
■ the gift would be deductible under section 110.1 in 
computing the corporation’s taxable income under Part I 
for the year if it were made immediately before the end 
of the donation year 
■ the corporation deducts the amount of the gift under this 
section for the corporation’s donation year 
■ the gift was in the form of cash or was transferred by 
way of cheque, credit card, money order or electronic 
payment 
The amount deductible by the corporation will generally be 
the eligible amount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift 
is the amount by which the fair market value of the 
property that is the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of 
the advantage, if any, in respect of the gift. For more 
information on the tax treatment of charitable gifts and the 
meaning of the term gift, see Pamphlet P113, Gifts and 
Income Tax, and Income Tax Folio S7-F1-C1, Split-receipting 
and Deemed Fair Market Value. 
Effective on registration of the amended Regulation, 
charities will be allowed to issue donation receipts 
electronically, if they contain all required information, they 
are issued in a secure and non-editable format, and the 
charity maintains an electronic copy of the receipts. 
Line 311 – Charitable donations 
Complete Schedule 2, Charitable Donations and Gifts, if, 
during the tax year, you made charitable donations, or 
unused charitable donations were transferred from a 
predecessor corporation after amalgamation or from a 
subsidiary corporation after wind-up. 
You can claim a deduction from net income for charitable 
donations made to any of the following qualified donees: 
■ registered charities (including registered national arts 
service organizations) 
■ registered journalism organizations 
■ registered Canadian amateur athletic associations 
■ registered housing corporations resident in Canada set 
up only to provide low-cost housing for the aged 
■ registered Canadian municipalities 
■ registered municipal or public bodies performing a 
function of government in Canada 
■ the United Nations or its agencies 
■ universities outside Canada, of which the student body 
ordinarily includes students from Canada, that are 
registered with the CRA 
■ registered foreign charities to which His Majesty in right 
of Canada had made a gift 
■ His Majesty in right of Canada, a province, or a territory 
References 
Subsections 149(1) and 149.1(1) 
The maximum amount of charitable donations that a 
corporation can deduct is equal to 75% of its net income 
(line 300). 
This limitation can be increased by the following amounts: 
■ 25% of the taxable capital gains arising from gifts of 
capital property made in the year and included in taxable 
income for the year; this amount is multiplied by the 
eligible amount of the gift divided by the corporation’s 
proceeds of disposition for the gift 
■ 25% of all taxable capital gains in the year from the 
disposition in a previous year of a non-qualifying 
security of a corporation that is making a gift to a 
qualified donee 
■ 25% of whichever is less: 
– the amount of recapture, included in the income of the 
year, arising from the donation of a prescribed class of 
depreciable property 
– the eligible amount of the gift divided by the 
corporation’s proceeds of disposition for the gift, 
multiplied by the lesser of the capital cost and the 
proceeds of disposition of the property minus any

outlays and expenses made for the purpose of making 
the disposition 
Charitable donations are deducted in the order they were 
made (first-in, first-out rule). 
If you are reporting nil net income or a loss for the year, 
you cannot claim donations to create or increase a loss. 
However, you can carry forward unused charitable 
donations and claim them in any of the five following tax 
years. 
Note 
On line 255 of Schedule 2, enter the amount of any other 
adjustments (these adjustments would apply to 
corporations that have undergone an acquisition of 
control and whose donations carryforward that accrued 
before the acquisition of control are not deductible after 
the acquisition of control). 
Complete Part 1 of Schedule 2 to calculate the total 
donations available and the charitable donations closing 
balance. 
Complete Part 2 of Schedule 2 to calculate the maximum 
deduction allowable and to determine the amount to claim

On line 311, enter the amount you want to deduct in 
calculating taxable income. This amount cannot be more 
than the lesser of: 
■ the total donations available 
■ the maximum deduction allowable 
Complete Part 6 of Schedule 2 to establish the continuity of 
charitable donations. 
You do not have to file receipts with your return. However, 
you have to keep them in case the CRA asks for them later. 
Notes 
When a credit union calculates its income for purposes 
of the 75% limit, it has to add back any amounts it 
previously deducted for bonus interest payments and 
payments for allocations in proportion to borrowing. 
Where a corporation makes a gift of a non-qualifying 
security, that gift has to be ignored for the charitable 
donations deduction. However, if the donee disposes of 
the security within 60 months, for consideration other 
than another non-qualifying security of any person, or 
the security ceases to be a non-qualifying security of the 
corporation within 60 months, the corporation will be 
treated as having made the gift at that later time. 
A non-qualifying security generally includes: 
■ an obligation of the corporation or a non-arm’s length 
person 
■ a share of the corporation or a share issued by a 
corporation with which the corporation does not deal 
at arm’s length 
■ the corporation’s beneficial interest in a trust in 
certain circumstances 
■ any other security issued by the corporation or a 
non-arm’s length person 
Specifically excepted from this definition are obligations, 
shares, and other securities listed on designated stock 
exchanges and deposits with financial institutions. 
The eligible amount of gifts to Canada, a province, or a 
territory is deductible on line 311 as charitable gifts under 
paragraph 110.1(1)(a). Monetary gifts to Canada should be 
made payable to the Receiver General for Canada. Send the 
gift, along with a note stating that the money is a gift to 
Canada, to: 
Place du Portage 
Phase III 
11 Laurier Street 
Gatineau QC  K1A 0S5 
If you made such a gift, you should have been provided 
with an official donation receipt.

Complete Part 3 of Schedule 2 if, during the tax year, one of 
the following occurred: 
■ you donated cultural gifts 
■ the cultural gifts were transferred from a predecessor 
corporation after amalgamation or from a subsidiary 
corporation after wind-up 
You can claim a deduction from net income for a gift of 
certified cultural property that you made to a designated 
institution or public authority. The most you can deduct is 
the total eligible amount of the gifts donated in the current 
tax year and any undeducted amounts from the 
five previous years. 
If the eligible amount of cultural gifts is more than your net 
income for the year minus other donations you claim, you 
can carry the excess forward for up to five years. 
Donations made after March 18, 2019, no longer require 
that property be of national importance (that is, have a 
direct connection with Canada’s cultural heritage) to 
qualify for the enhanced tax incentives for donations of 
cultural property. Enhanced tax incentives include an 
enhanced charitable donation deduction and an income tax 
exemption for any capital gains arising on the disposition 
of the property. 
If the certified cultural property is acquired as part of a 
gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter, the fair market 
value (FMV) of the property is deemed to be the lesser of 
the FMV of the property otherwise determined and its cost 
to the donor. For more information about the deemed 
FMV rule, see Pamphlet P113, Gifts and Income Tax, and

Line 314 – Ecological gifts 
Complete Part 4 of Schedule 2 if, during the tax year, one of 
the following occurred: 
■ you made certified ecological gifts 
■ the ecological gifts were transferred from a predecessor 
corporation after amalgamation, or from a subsidiary 
corporation after wind-up 
You can claim a deduction from net income for certified 
ecological gifts made to: 
■ Canada, a province, or a territory 
■ an approved Canadian municipality or municipal or 
public body performing a function of government in 
Canada 
■ an approved registered charity (other than a private 
foundation) 
An ecological gift is a gift of land (including a covenant, an 
easement, or, in the case of land in Quebec, a personal 
servitude that runs for at least 100 years or a real servitude) 
that is certified by the minister of Environment and Climate 
Change (ECC) as ecologically sensitive. 
The eligible amount of a gift of ecologically sensitive land 
and, consequently, the corporate donor’s proceeds of 
disposition are considered to be the amount determined by 
the minister of ECC. 
Ecologically sensitive land must be protected and should 
not be used for other purposes. A tax of 50% of the fair 
market value of the land will be charged to recipients who 
change the use of the land or dispose of it without the 
consent of the minister of ECC. 
The maximum deduction you can claim is the total of 
ecological gifts made during the current tax year plus the 
unclaimed ecological gifts from the 10 previous tax years, if 
the gift was made on or after February 11, 2014. 
If the amount of ecological gifts is more than your net 
income for the year minus any other donations you claim, 
you can carry the excess forward for up to 10 years. 
Note 
On line 555 of Schedule 2, enter the amount of any other

Section 112 and subsection 138(6) of the Act allow 
corporations that receive intercorporate dividends to claim 
a deduction equal to the amount of dividends received. 
The dividend received deduction under subsections 112(1), 
112(2), and 138(6) will be denied for any dividends received 
or deemed received (if the shares were held by the financial 
institution) after 2023 by a corporation that is a financial 
institution (as defined in 142.2(1)). This applies to shares 
that are mark-to-market (MTM) property or tracking 
property of the corporation (or that would be MTM 
property of the corporation for the year if the share was 
held at any time in the year by the corporation). 
As an exception, this measure does not generally apply to 
dividends received on taxable preferred shares (as defined 
in the Income Tax Act). 
Shares are considered MTM property when a financial 
institution holds less than 10% of the vote or value of the 
corporation that issued the shares. A tracking property is a 
property the fair market value of which is determined by 
reference to certain attributes of another property that 
would be MTM property if held directly by the corporation. 
When calculating taxable income, you can deduct, under 
section 112, any of the following types of taxable dividends 
received: 
■ dividends from a taxable Canadian corporation, or from

Line 352 – Employer deduction for 
non-qualified securities 
Canada’s tax treatment of employee stock options granted 
after June 30, 2021, will apply a $200,000 annual limit (on a 
calendar year basis) on employee stock option grants that 
can receive preferred tax treatment. 
Generally, employee stock option benefits will remain 
uncapped for Canadian-controlled private 
corporations (CCPCs) and non-CCPCs employers with 
annual gross revenue of $500 million or less (taking into 
account the gross revenue of a corporate group that 
prepared a consolidated financial statement, when the 
employer is member of such a group). 
If a security is deemed to be a non-qualified security for the 
50% stock option deduction (either in the case of 
designation by the employer or because it was more than 
the annual vesting limit), the employer will be able to claim 
a deduction equal to the benefit received by an employee 
where the security would otherwise be deductible under 
paragraph 110(1)(d). 
The employer will have to notify: 
■ the employee, in writing, that the security is a 
non-qualified security no later than 30 days after the day 
that the agreement is entered into 
■ the Canada Revenue Agency that the security is a 
non-qualified security by filing Schedule 59, Information 
Return for Non-Qualified Securities, with its T2 return for 
the tax year that includes the day on which the 
agreement is entered into

Line 355 – Section 110.5 additions or 
subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) additions 
You can use foreign tax deductions to reduce Part I tax that 
you would otherwise have to pay. Under section 110.5 and 
subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii), a corporation that cannot 
deduct its foreign income tax deductions (for example, if it 
has no Part I tax payable for the year) can choose to add an 
amount to its taxable income. In this way, the corporation 
can use these otherwise non-deductible foreign tax 
deductions. 
The amount you add to income for this purpose forms part 
of the non-capital loss. See page 67 for details. 
However, you cannot add an amount under section 110.5 if 
that addition increases any of the following deductible 
amounts: 
■ the small business deduction 
■ the manufacturing and processing profits deduction 
■ the federal logging tax credit 
■ the investment tax credit (ITC) 
■ the share-purchase tax credit 
■ the SR&ED investment tax credit 
If the corporation is an authorized foreign bank, you cannot 
add an amount under subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) if that 
addition increases any of the following deductible 
amounts: 
■ the federal logging tax credit 
■ the ITC 
On line 355, enter the amount you added to income under 
section 110.5 or subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii). 
Line 360 – Taxable income 
To calculate this amount, subtract all the deductions you 
entered on lines 311 to 352 from the net income for income 
tax purposes on line 300. Add, if it applies, section 110.5 or 
subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) additions (line 355). Enter the 
taxable income on line 360. 
If the result is a loss, enter “0” on line 360. 
Note 
If you want to carry back a current-year loss to a 
previous tax year, see “How to complete Schedule 4” on

Small business deduction 
Corporations that were Canadian-controlled private 
corporations (CCPCs) throughout the tax year may be able 
to claim the small business deduction (SBD). The SBD 
reduces Part I tax that the corporation would otherwise 
have to pay. 
The SBD is 19% of whichever of the following amounts is 
less: 
■ the income from active business carried on in Canada 
(line 400) 
■ the taxable income (line 405) 
■ the business limit (line 410) 
■ the amount on line 428, which is the reduced business 
limit on line 426 from which you deduct the amount of 
the business limit you assigned under subsection 125(3.2) 
The basic rate of Part I tax being 38% of your taxable 
income, 28% after the federal tax abatement, the SBD rate 
results in a 9% tax rate. 
Once you have calculated the SBD, enter it on line 430. 
The following sections explain each of the above amounts. 
Avoidance of the business limit and taxable 
capital limit 
Where two corporations (Corps A and B) are deemed to be 
associated because they are associated with the same third 
corporation (Corp C), but because the third corporation, a 
CCPC, has filed a Schedule 28 election (see page 34), they 
are deemed not to be associated with each other for 
determining the SBD, the following applies: 
■ investment income derived from Corp C that is deemed 
by subsection 129(6) to be active business income is not 
eligible for the SBD and is taxed at the general 
corporation income tax rate 
■ Corps A and B remain associated with Corp C. They 
must include the taxable capital limit of Corp C when 
calculating the SBD 
Preventing multiplication of the small 
business deduction 
To address concerns about partnership structures that 
multiply access to the SBD, the specified partnership 
income rules also apply, for example, to partnership 
structures in which a CCPC provides services or property 
to a partnership during the tax year of the CCPC, where the 
CCPC or a shareholder of the CCPC is a member of the 
partnership. A similar measure also applies for corporate 
structures that multiply access to the SBD. 
Line 400 – Income from active business 
carried on in Canada 
Complete Schedule 7, Aggregate Investment Income and 
Income Eligible for the Small Business Deduction, to determine 
the following amounts: 
■ the aggregate investment income and foreign investment 
income for determining the refundable portion of Part I 
tax (see “Refundable portion of Part I tax, Lines 440, 445, 
and 450” on page 80 for details) 
■ the specified partnership income for members (or 
designated members) of a partnership 
■ the income from an active business carried on in Canada 
for the SBD 
CCPCs may now assign all or part of their business limit 
under subsection 125(3.2) or specified partnership business 
limit under subsection 125(8) to another corporation. 
Use Schedule 7 to assign all or part of your specified 
partnership business limit to another corporation. 
Also file Schedule 7 if another corporation assigned all or 
part of its business limit to your CCPC or if a member of a 
partnership assigned all or part of the member’s specified 
partnership business limit to your CCPC. 
If you are assigning all or part of your business limit to 
another corporation, report it on page 4 of the T2 return. 
Note 
If claiming a deduction for patronage dividends on 
line 416 of Schedule 1, complete Part 5 of Schedule 16 to 
establish active business income carried on in Canada 
(see page 65 for details).

Active business income 
Generally, active business income is income earned from a 
business source, including any income incidental to the 
business. 
Income from a specified investment business or from a 
personal services business, and income described in 
subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of specified corporate 
income in subsection 125(7) for the year are generally not 
considered active business income and are not eligible for 
the SBD. The following three sections explain when income 
from these types of businesses may be considered active 
business income and eligible for the SBD. 
Specified investment business 
A specified investment business is a business with the 
principal purpose of deriving income from property, 
including interest, dividends, rents, or royalties. It also 
includes a business carried on by a prescribed 
labour-sponsored venture capital corporation, the principal 
purpose of which is to derive income from property. 
Except for a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital 
corporation, income from a specified investment business is 
considered to be active business income, and is therefore 
eligible for the SBD if: 
■ the corporation employs more than five full-time 
employees in the business throughout the year, or 
■ an associated corporation provides managerial, financial, 
administrative, maintenance, or other similar services to 
the corporation while carrying on an active business, and 
the corporation would have to engage more than 
five full-time employees to perform these services if the 
associated corporation were not providing them 
Note 
The business a credit union carries on, or the business of 
leasing property other than real property, is not 
considered specified investment business. 
Personal services business 
A personal services business is a business that a 
corporation carries on to provide services to another entity 
(such as a person or a partnership) that an officer or 
employee of that entity would usually perform. Instead, an 
individual performs the services on behalf of the 
corporation. That individual is called an incorporated 
employee. 
Any income the corporation derives from providing the 
services is considered income from a personal services 
business, as long as both of the following conditions are 
met: 
■ the incorporated employee who is performing the 
services, or any person related to him or her, is a 
specified shareholder of the corporation 
■ the incorporated employee would, if it were not for the 
existence of the corporation, reasonably be considered an 
officer or employee of the entity receiving the services 
However, if the corporation employs more than 
five full-time employees throughout the year or provides 
the services to an associated corporation, the income is not 
considered to be from a personal services business. 
Therefore, the income is eligible for the SBD. 
Deductions in computing income for a personal services 
business are restricted to the following: 
■ salary, wages, or other remuneration of the incorporated 
employee 
■ cost of other benefits or allowances provided to the 
incorporated employee 
■ certain expenses of the corporation associated with 
selling property or negotiating contracts 
■ legal expenses paid in the year by the corporation in 
collecting amounts owed for services rendered 
Note 
Any expenses denied must be added back on Schedule 1. 
For more information on the factors to take into account 
when a person is considered an employee, see 
Guide RC4110, Employee or self-employed? or go 
to canada.ca/cpp-ei-rulings. 
Reference 
Paragraph 18(1)(p) 
Specified corporate income 
Generally, where a CCPC earns income that would 
otherwise be considered as income from an active business 
from providing property or services to another private 
corporation and it (or one of its shareholders) or a person 
who does not deal at arm’s length with the CCPC (or one of 
its shareholders) holds a direct or indirect interest in that 
other private corporation, the income would not be 
considered as being eligible for the SBD unless certain 
conditions are met. 
For more information, see the definition of specified 
corporate income in subsection 125(7). 
Specified farming or fishing income 
The definition of specified farming or fishing income 
replaced the definition of specified cooperative income, 
which has been retroactively repealed. The definition of 
specified corporate income excludes specified farming or 
fishing income, so that such income stays eligible for the 
SBD by default. 
Specified farming or fishing income, of a corporation for a 
tax year, means income of the corporation (other than an 
amount included in its income under subsection 135(7), 
patronage dividends), if both of the following conditions 
are met: 
■ the income is from the sale of the farming products or 
fishing catches of the corporation’s farming or fishing 
business to another corporation 
■ the corporation deals at arm’s length with the other 
corporation 
This approach eliminates the requirement that sales have to 
be to a farming or fishing cooperative corporation in order 
to be excluded from specified corporate income.

Note 
You have to request a reassessment if, in a previous year 
that started after March 21, 2016, you had income that 
meets the definition of specified farming or fishing 
income, but did not meet the definition of specified 
cooperative income. The CRA can reassess beyond the 
normal reassessment period for this specific purpose. 
You will find information on how to request a 
reassessment on page 21. 
Specified shareholder 
A specified shareholder is a taxpayer who owns, directly or 
indirectly at any time in the year, at least 10% of the issued 
shares of any class of capital stock of the corporation or a 
related corporation. 
How to calculate income from an active business 
carried on in Canada 
Generally, to calculate active business income from 
carrying on a business in Canada, you have to deduct from 
net income for income tax purposes any of the following 
amounts that apply: 
■ taxable capital gains minus allowable capital losses 
■ dividends that are deductible from income under 
sections 112 and 113, and subsection 138(6) 
■ property income minus property losses 
■ property income from an interest in a trust 
■ foreign business income 
■ income from a specified investment business 
■ income from a personal services business 
■ income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition 
of specified corporate income in subsection 125(7) for the 
year where certain conditions are not met 
Specified partnership income 
A corporation that is a member (or a designated member) 
of a partnership has to complete Schedule 7 to calculate its 
active business income. 
The specified partnership income rules impose a limit on 
the amount of active business income earned by a 
corporation as a member or designated member of a 
partnership that is eligible for the SBD. The eligible amount 
is referred to as specified partnership income and is added 
to the corporation’s active business income from other 
sources, if any. 
For members of a partnership, their specified partnership 
business limit is normally their pro-rata share of a notional 
$500,000 business limit for the partnership. 
For designated members of a partnership, their specified 
partnership business limit is nil, unless they get an amount 
assigned from a member of the partnership. 
If the partnership incurs a loss from carrying on an active 
business, you have to deduct the corporation’s share of that 
loss from its active business income. This is referred to as a 
specified partnership loss. 
If your corporation is a member of a partnership in respect 
of which it filed a Schedule 73, you have to add or deduct 
the total active business income determined under 
section 34.2. 
If the corporation received an information slip T5013, 
Statement of Partnership Income, that shows its share of 
partnership income or loss, keep it in case the CRA asks for 
it later. Do not include this form with the return. For more 
information, see page 35 and Guide T4068, Guide for the 
Partnership Information Return (T5013 Forms). 
On line 400, enter the total active business income you 
calculated on Schedule 7.

Line 405 – Taxable income for the SBD 
The taxable income you use to calculate the SBD is usually 
the amount entered on line 360. However, if you have 
claimed a foreign non-business income tax credit, a foreign 
business income tax credit, or both, you have to reduce the 
taxable income by both of the following: 
■ 100/28 of the amount that would be deductible as a 
federal foreign non-business income tax credit on 
line 632, if that credit was determined without the 
refundable tax on the CCPC’s investment income 
(line 604) and without reference to the corporate tax 
reduction under section 123.4 
■ four times the amount that would be deductible as a 
federal foreign business income tax credit (line 636) if 
that credit was determined without reference to the 
corporate tax reduction under section 123.4. See page 79 
You also have to reduce taxable income by any amount 
that, because of federal law, is exempt from Part I tax. 
On line 405, enter your taxable income for the purposes of 
calculating the SBD.

CCPCs that are associated with one or more corporations 
during the tax year have to file Schedule 23, Agreement 
Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to 
Allocate the Business Limit. On this schedule, a percentage of 
the business limit is allocated to each corporation, and the 
total of all percentages cannot be more than 100%. See 
page 33 for details about Schedule 23. 
On line 410, enter the business limit for the year. If 
applicable, enter the amount from Schedule 23.

Notes 
If the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, you have to 
prorate the business limit, based on the number of days 
in the tax year divided by 365, before you enter it on 
line 410. 
If a CCPC is associated with two other corporations and 
elects for the two other corporations not to be associated 
with each other for the purpose of the line 616

Line 426 – Reduced business limit 
The reduction in a CCPC’s business limit is the greater of its 
taxable capital business limit reduction and its passive 
income business limit reduction for the year. 
Taxable capital business limit reduction 
Large CCPCs that have taxable capital employed in Canada 
of $50 million or more do not qualify for the SBD. The 
business limit is reduced on a straight-line basis for CCPCs 
that have taxable capital employed in Canada of between 
$10 million and $50 million in the previous year. For tax 
years starting before April 7, 2022, the range is $10 million 
to $15 million. 
Similar restrictions apply to any CCPC that is a member of 
an associated group that has, in total, more than $10 million 
of taxable capital employed in Canada. 
To calculate the total taxable capital employed in Canada, 
use the schedule that applies: 
■ Schedule 33, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large 
Corporations 
■ Schedule 34, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – 
Financial Institutions 
■ Schedule 35, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large 
Insurance Corporations 
If your taxable capital employed in Canada is more than 
$10 million, file the appropriate schedule with your return. 
Passive income business limit reduction 
The business limit of a CCPC is also reduced if the CCPC, 
and any other corporation it is associated with, earn 
combined income from $50,000 to $150,000 from passive 
investments. The business limit is nil once the combined 
income from passive investments is more than $150,000. 
This income is calculated in Part 2 of Schedule 7, Aggregate 
Investment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business 
Deduction, and is referred to as the adjusted aggregate 
investment income. 
Enter the greater amount of the reduction on line 422 and 
the resulting reduced business limit on line 426. 
Use Schedule 23, Agreement Among Associated 
Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the 
Business Limit, if you are an associated CCPC. For more 
information about this schedule, see page 33.

business number of the corporation to which you assign 
such an amount on page 4 of the T2 return. Deduct from

General tax reduction 
A general tax reduction of 13% is available on qualifying 
income. 
Corporations benefit from the general tax reduction only on 
taxable income that is subject to a rate of 38%. 
The reduction does not apply to income that benefits from 
preferential corporate tax treatment, such as: 
■ income eligible for the small business deduction and

Refundable portion of Part I tax 
Lines 440, 445, and 450 
The refundable portion of Part I tax is part of the 
non-eligible refundable dividend tax on hand (NERDTOH). 
More information about NERDTOH is in the section that 
follows. 
The refundable portion of Part I tax allows a CCPC that has 
paid Part I tax on investment income to recover part of that 
tax when the corporation pays taxable dividends to its 
shareholders. The refundable portion of Part I tax only 
applies to corporations that are CCPCs throughout the tax 
year. 
The refundable portion of Part I tax is based on the 
aggregate investment income and foreign investment 
income. You have to determine these amounts by 
completing Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 7, Aggregate 
Investment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business 
Deduction. 
Part 1 – Aggregate investment income calculation 
The aggregate investment income is the aggregate world 
source income calculated as follows: 
add 
■ the eligible portion of the taxable capital gains for the 
year that is more than the total of: 
– the eligible portion of allowable capital losses for the 
year 
– the net capital losses from previous years which are 
applied in the year 
■ total income from property (including income from a 
specified investment business carried on in Canada other 
than income from a source outside Canada) from which 
the following amounts have been deducted: 
– exempt income 
– AgriInvest receipts (include the Quebec amount) 
– taxable dividends deductible after deducting related 
expenses 
– business income from an interest in a trust that is 
considered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a) 
deduct 
■ total losses for the year from property (including losses 
from a specified investment business carried on in 
Canada other than losses from a source outside Canada) 
On line 440 enter the amount of aggregate investment 
income that you determined on line 092 of Schedule 7. 
You can include taxable capital gains and allowable capital 
losses in a CCPC’s net investment income only if you can 
attribute the gain or loss to a period of time when a CCPC, 
an investment corporation, a mortgage investment 
corporation, or a mutual fund corporation held the 
disposed property. 
Note 
Part 2, Adjusted Aggregate Investment Income, of 
Schedule 7, is used to calculate the small business 
deduction for tax years starting after 2018 on page 4 of 
the return. 
Part 3 – Foreign investment income calculation 
The foreign investment income is all income from only 
sources outside of Canada calculated as follows: 
add 
■ the eligible portion of the taxable capital gains for the 
year that is more than the eligible portion of allowable 
capital losses for the year 
■ the total income from property from a source outside 
Canada from which the following amounts have been 
deducted: 
– exempt income 
– taxable dividends deductible after deducting related 
expenses 
– business income from an interest in a trust that is 
considered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a) 
deduct 
■ the total losses for the year from property from a source 
outside Canada 
On line 445 enter the amount of foreign investment income 
that you determined on line 079 of Schedule 7. 
Calculate the amount of the refundable portion of Part I tax. 
For years starting after 2018, enter the amount from line 450 
at amount H in the “Refundable dividend tax on hand” 
area on page 7 of your return.

Refundable dividend tax on hand 
The calculation of a private corporation’s dividend refund 
is based on two accounts, the eligible refundable dividend 
tax on hand (ERDTOH) and the non-eligible refundable 
dividend tax on hand (NERDTOH).

For more information on eligible dividends, go to 
canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends or see page 94. 
Lines 530 and 545 
The ERDTOH and NERDTOH accounts only apply to 
corporations that were private or subject corporations, 
which are defined on page 95. 
CCPCs and substantive CCPCs generate NERDTOH on the 
refundable portion of Part I tax they pay on investment 
income. They also generate both ERDTOH and NERDTOH 
on the Part IV tax they pay on dividends they receive. For 
any other type of private corporation, only the Part IV tax it 
pays generates ERDTOH and NERDTOH. 
For more information on taxable dividends deductible 
under section 112 or 113, or subsection 138(6), see Line 320 
on page 72. 
For information on Part IV tax and instructions to complete 
Schedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable Dividends Paid, and 
Part IV Tax Calculations, see Line 712 on page 95. 
All or part of the ERDTOH and NERDTOH at the end of 
the tax year may be available as a refund if the corporation 
pays taxable dividends to the shareholders during the tax 
year. 
You can view the eligible and non-eligible refundable 
dividend tax on hand balances using the “View return 
balances” service through: 
■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are the business owner 
■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
To calculate the ERDTOH at the end of the tax year, add the 
following amounts: 
■ the ERDTOH balance at the end of the previous tax year 
(minus any dividend refund from ERDTOH issued to the 
corporation in the previous year) (line 520 minus 
amount G) 
■ any balance of ERDTOH transferred from a predecessor 
corporation on amalgamation, or from a wound-up 
subsidiary corporation (line 525) 
■ Part IV taxes payable (amount Q) on: 
– eligible dividends received from non-connected 
corporations 
–  taxable dividends received from connected 
corporations to the extent that the payment of the 
dividends caused a dividend refund to the payer 
corporation from its ERDTOH 
To calculate the NERDTOH at the end of the tax year, 
add the following amounts: 
■ the NERDTOH balance at the end of the previous tax 
year (minus any dividend refund from NERTDOH 
issued to the corporation in the previous year) (line 535 
minus line 575) 
■ the refundable portion of Part I tax (line 450) 
■ any balance of NERDTOH transferred from a 
predecessor corporation on amalgamation, or from a 
wound-up subsidiary corporation (line 540) 
■ Part IV tax payable (excluding amounts allocated to 
ERDTOH) (amount P) 
Note 
A predecessor corporation or a subsidiary cannot 
transfer any ERDTOH or NERDTOH to a new or parent 
corporation as a result of an amalgamation or wind-up 
if, had the predecessor or subsidiary corporation paid a 
dividend just before the amalgamation or wind-up, 
subsection 129(1.2) would have applied to that dividend. 
Enter the ERDTOH at the end of the tax year on line 530 
and at amount BB in the “Dividend refund” area on page 7 
of your return. Enter the NERDTOH at the end of the tax 
year on line 545 and at amount EE in the same area.

Subsections 129(4) and 186(5) 
Dividend refund 
A private corporation’s eligible dividends generate 
dividend refunds from the ERDTOH. Non-eligible 
dividends generate dividend refunds from the NERDTOH 
first, and then possibly from the ERDTOH. The calculation 
effectively requires a private corporation to get a refund 
from its NERDTOH account before it gets a refund from 
its ERDTOH account, when it pays a non-eligible dividend. 
Note 
To claim a dividend refund or to apply the amount to 
another debit for any tax year, including the same tax 
year, you have to file your income tax return within 
three years of the end of the tax year. If your income tax 
return is not filed within three years of the end of the tax 
year, the dividend refund becomes statute-barred, and 
will not be issued. 
A dividend refund may arise if you pay taxable dividends 
to shareholders, and if there is an amount of NERDTOH 
or ERDTOH at the end of the tax year. Taxable dividends 
paid include the following: 
■ stock dividends 
■ section 84 deemed dividends 
■ amounts paid as interest or dividends on income bonds 
or debentures that are not deductible when calculating 
income 
To claim a dividend refund, you must make an actual 
payment to the shareholders unless the dividend is 
considered paid (a deemed dividend). This payment can be 
either in cash or with some other tangible assets. In the 
latter case, the amount of the dividend is the fair market 
value of the asset transferred. 
A private or subject corporation may be entitled to a 
dividend refund for dividends it paid while it was a private 
or subject corporation, regardless of whether it was a 
private or subject corporation at the end of the tax year. If 
the corporation loses its private status following a change 
in control, a deemed year-end occurs. The corporation may 
be allowed to claim a dividend refund for any taxable 
dividends paid during the deemed short year.

You have to complete parts 3 and 4 (if they apply) of 
Schedule 3 to claim a dividend refund. 
The dividend refund is equal to the total of the following 
amounts: 
■ for eligible dividends, the amount (referred to below as 
amount 1) that is the lesser of 38 1/3% of the total of all 
eligible dividends you paid in the year and 
your ERDTOH account balance at the end of the year 
■ for non-eligible dividends, the total of the two following 
amounts: 
– the amount that is the lesser of 38 1/3% of the total of 
all non-eligible dividends you paid in the year and 
your NERDTOH account balance at the end of the year 
– the amount that is the lesser of: 
■ the amount, if any, by which 38 1/3% of the total of 
all non-eligible dividends you paid in the year is 
more than your NERDTOH account balance at the 
end of the year 
■ the amount, if any, by which your ERDTOH account 
balance at the end of the year is more than amount 1 
The total of taxable dividends paid in the tax year that 
qualify for a dividend refund is equal to the amount on 
line 460 of Schedule 3. Eligible refundable dividend tax on 
hand refers to line 530 of the return and non-eligible 
refundable dividend tax on hand refers to line 545. 
Parts 3 and 4 of Schedule 3 
The following explains how to complete Parts 3 and 4 of 
Schedule 3. Parts 1 and 2 are explained on page 96. 
If you paid taxable dividends during the year, complete 
Part 3 to identify taxable dividends that qualify for the 
dividend refund. 
If the amount of dividends paid includes dividends that do 
not qualify for the dividend refund, you have to deduct 
these dividends before completing the calculation in Part 3. 
In this case, complete Part 4 of Schedule 3 to identify 
dividends that do not qualify. 
Dividends that do not qualify are: 
■ dividends paid out of the capital dividend account 
■ capital gains dividends 
■ dividends paid for shares that do not qualify as taxable 
dividends, because the main purpose of acquiring the 
shares was to receive a dividend refund 
[subsection 129(1.2)] 
■ taxable dividends paid to a controlling corporation that 
was bankrupt at any time in the year 
Complete Part 3 of Schedule 3 to identify a connected 
corporation that received taxable dividends that qualify for 
the dividend refund. 
If the dividend refund is more than the amount of Part I tax 
payable for the year, the CRA deducts the excess from any 
other taxes owed under the Income Tax Act. Any balance left 
over is available for a refund. 
If the total dividends paid during the year is different from 
the total of taxable dividends paid for the purpose of the 
dividend refund, complete Part 4 of Schedule 3.

Section 123.5 
Line 565 – Additional tax on banks and life 
insurers 
For tax years that end after April 7, 2022, an additional tax 
of 1.5% of the taxable income is introduced for members of

member in the group that is a bank, life insurer or other 
related financial institution. 
A $100 million taxable income exemption could be 
allocated by agreement amongst group members. For a tax 
year that includes April 7, 2022, the additional tax would be 
prorated based on the number of days after April 7, 2022.

Line 580 – Total labour requirements addition 
to tax 
For clean economy ITCs other than the clean technology 
manufacturing ITC, there are consequences for not 
complying with the labour requirements – prevailing wage 
requirements and apprenticeship requirements – if you 
have attested and elected to meet the labour requirements 
and claimed the credit at the regular rate. 
Addition to tax for prevailing wages not paid 
You will be liable to pay a dollar amount per day for each 
day in the installation tax year, for each covered worker 
who was not paid the prevailing wage, except when gross 
negligence applies. The dollar amount will be $20 in 2023 
and will be adjusted for inflation in each calendar year 
after 2023. 
You may also be liable to pay a corrective measure in the 
form of a top-up amount to each covered worker as per 
notification from the minister. 
This amount is the difference between prevailing wages 
that were required to have been paid to the covered worker 
and the amount that the covered worker was actually paid 
for the year, plus interest 
You have one year after receiving the notification to pay the 
top-up amount.

If you do not pay the top-up amount, you will be liable to 
pay a penalty of 120% of the top-up amount that was 
determined for each covered worker. 
If you have not been grossly negligent, you will still be able 
to claim the ITC at the regular credit rate, even if the above 
addition to tax provisions for prevailing wage applies. 
Addition to tax for apprenticeship hours not met 
You will be liable to pay a dollar amount multiplied by the 
difference between the total hours of labour that were 
required to be performed by apprentices registered in a 
Red Seal trade, and the total hours of labour that were 
actually performed by apprentices registered in Red Seal 
trades, plus any other hours of labour for which you met 
the apprenticeship requirements. The dollar amount is $50 
in 2023 and will be adjusted for inflation in each calendar 
year after 2023. 
If you have not been grossly negligent, you will still be able 
to claim the ITC at the regular credit rate, even if the above 
addition to tax provisions for apprenticeship requirements 
applies. 
Enter the amount of the total addition to tax on line 580 of 
the return. 
Line 602 – Recapture of investment tax 
credit (ITC) 
Scientific research and experimental development 
A corporation that disposed of a property used in scientific 
research and experimental development (SR&ED), or 
converted it to commercial use, should report a recapture in 
its income tax return for the year in which the disposition 
or conversion occurred. 
If you disposed of a property on which you earned 
SR&ED ITC, the recapture will be whichever is less: 
■ the ITC earned for the property 
■ the amount determined by applying the percentage you 
used in calculating the ITC earned on the property to: 
– the proceeds of disposition of the property if you 
dispose of it to an arm’s length person 
– in any other case, the fair market value of the property 
If you did the SR&ED and transferred the qualified 
expenditures to a non-arm’s length party according to an 
agreement as described in subsection 127(13), the recapture 
will be whichever is less: 
■ the ITC earned by the transferee on the qualified 
expenditures for the property that was transferred 
■ the amount determined by the formula: 
A × B – C 
where 
– “A” is the percentage that the transferee used in 
determining its ITC 
– “B” is the proceeds of disposition of the property if you 
dispose of it to an arm’s length person, or in any other 
case, the fair market value of the property 
– “C” is the amount, if any, added to the tax payable 
under subsection 127(27) for the property. This allows 
for the situation where you transferred only a portion 
of the cost of the property in an agreement under 
subsection 127(13) 
If you transferred a portion of the expenditures and 
claimed a portion of that expenditure for ITC purposes, 
both calculations will apply. 
The recapture period for ITCs is 20 years. 
For more information, see parts 16 and 17 of Schedule 31, 
Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, on how to calculate the 
recapture of SR&ED ITC or go to canada.ca/taxes-sred. 
Child care spaces 
Note 
The ITC for child care spaces is eliminated for 
expenditures incurred after March 21, 2017. See page 90. 
The ITC for child care spaces will be added to the 
taxpayer’s tax otherwise payable if, at any time within the 
60 months of the day on which the taxpayer acquired the 
property: 
■ the new child care space is no longer available, or 
■ eligible property for purposes of this credit is sold or 
leased to another person or converted to another use 
If the property disposed of is a child care space, the amount 
to be recaptured will be the amount that can reasonably be 
considered to have been included in the original ITC. 
For eligible expenditures, the amount to be recaptured will 
be the lesser of: 
■ the amount that can reasonably be considered to have 
been included in the original ITC 
■ 25% of the proceeds of disposition of the eligible 
property or of its fair market value at the time of 
disposition, if the property was disposed of to a 
non-arm’s length person 
Use Schedule 31 to calculate the recapture of ITC. 
Clean economy 
Enter the amount of the recapture for each clean economy 
ITC (except for the CCUS ITC) in Part 25 of Schedule 31. 
The amounts are determined on the credit calculation 
schedules for each clean economy ITC. For more 
information on recapture, go to canada.ca/en

Line 616 – Manufacturing and processing 
profits deduction and zero-emission 
technology manufacturing deduction 
Corporations that derive at least 10% of their gross revenue 
for the year from manufacturing or processing goods in 
Canada for sale or lease can claim the manufacturing and 
processing profits deduction (MPPD). The MPPD reduces 
Part I tax otherwise payable. 
The MPPD applies to the part of taxable income that 
represents Canadian manufacturing and processing profits. 
Calculate the MPPD at the rate of 13% on income that is not 
eligible for the small business deduction (SBD). 
A temporary measure reduces the corporate tax rates for 
manufacturers of qualified zero-emission technology for tax 
years starting after 2021. 
Income that would otherwise be subject to the 15% general 
corporate rate is now taxed at a 7.5% rate. Income that 
would otherwise be taxed at the 9% small-business rate is 
now taxed at a 4.5% rate. 
The temporary measure has been extended by three years. 
The reduced rates will be gradually phased out starting in 
tax years that begin in 2032 and fully phased out for tax 
years that begin after 2034, as follows:

At least 10% of the corporation’s gross revenue from all 
active businesses carried on in Canada must be derived 
from eligible activities. Eligible activities include things 
such as: 
■ manufacturing of energy conversion equipment (for 
example, solar, wind, water, and geothermal equipment) 
■ manufacturing of air-source heat pumps used for space 
or water heating 
■ most manufacturing activities around zero-emission 
vehicles (for example, manufacturing of vehicles, 
batteries and charging stations) 
■ for tax years starting after 2023, the following nuclear 
manufacturing and processing activities: 
– manufacturing of nuclear energy equipment 
– processing or recycling of nuclear fuels and heavy 
water 
– manufacturing of nuclear fuel rods 
Use Schedule 27, Calculation of Canadian Manufacturing and 
Processing Profits Deduction, to calculate the manufacturing 
and processing profits deduction and the zero-emission 
technology manufacturing deduction. 
There are two ways to calculate Canadian manufacturing 
and processing profits: a simplified method for small 
manufacturing corporations, and a basic labour and capital 
employed in qualified activities formula for other 
corporations. These methods are outlined in parts 1 and 2 
of Schedule 27. 
Note 
The new reduced tax rate for zero-emission technology 
applies only to the corporation’s zero-emission 
technology manufacturing profits, defined in 
subsection 125.2(2) of the Act. These profits are equal to 
the corporation’s adjusted business income multiplied 
by the proportion of its total labour and capital cost that 
are used in zero emission technology manufacturing. 
Small manufacturing corporations only have to complete 
Part 1 of Schedule 27 and are entitled to calculate the MPPD 
on their entire adjusted business income. Essentially, a 
corporation’s adjusted business income is its income from 
an active business it carried on in Canada that is more than 
its losses from similar businesses. If the corporation is 
involved in resource activities, it has to reduce the adjusted 
business income by its net resource income, its refund 
interest, and part of its prescribed resource loss. 
Schedule 27 shows how to calculate the adjusted business 
income. 
To qualify as a small manufacturing corporation, you have

Lines 620 and 624 – Investment corporation 
deduction 
A Canadian public corporation that is an investment 
corporation, as defined in subsection 130(3), can claim a 
deduction from Part I tax that the corporation would 
otherwise have to pay. This deduction is equal to 20% of 
the taxable income for the year that is more than the taxed 
capital gains for the year. 
On line 624, enter the investment corporation’s taxed 
capital gains. On line 620, enter the amount of the 
deduction you are claiming.

Line 632 – Federal foreign non-business 
income tax credit 
Use Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign 
Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to 
calculate this credit. 
A federal foreign non-business income tax credit is 
available to Canadian residents to prevent double taxation 
of any non-business income earned in a foreign country 
that was taxed by that foreign country. The credit is also 
available to authorized foreign banks on their Canadian 
banking business from sources in a foreign country. This 
credit reduces Part I tax that the corporation would 
otherwise have to pay. 
Foreign non-business income includes dividends, interest, 
and capital gains. It does not include dividends received 
from foreign affiliates, or income from operating a business 
in a foreign country. 
Foreign non-business income tax does not include any 
foreign tax paid on income that is exempt from tax in 
Canada under an income tax treaty. 
As another option, under subsection 20(12), instead of 
claiming a foreign non-business income tax credit, a 
corporation can deduct from income all or any part of 
non-business income tax it paid to a foreign country. 
If, after you claim the federal foreign non-business income 
tax credit, there is any foreign non-business income tax left 
over, you can claim it as a provincial or territorial foreign 
tax credit. See page 101 for details. 
Under section 110.5 and subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii), you 
can also increase your taxable income so that you can use 
an otherwise non-deductible foreign non-business income 
tax credit. See “Line 355 – Section 110.5 additions or 
subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) additions” on page 74 for 
details. 
To claim this credit, complete Part 1 of Schedule 21. 
Calculate the federal foreign non-business income tax credit 
for each country separately. Use more than one schedule if 
more space is required. 
Add all the allowable foreign non-business income tax 
credits in column I on Schedule 21. Then, enter the total 
allowable credit or a lesser amount on line 632.

tax credit 
Use Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign 
Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to 
calculate this credit. 
To prevent double taxation, a corporation that pays foreign 
tax on income or profits it earned from operating a business 
in a foreign country can claim a federal foreign business 
income tax credit. This credit reduces the Part I tax that the 
corporation would otherwise have to pay. 
Unlike foreign non-business income tax, you cannot deduct 
excess foreign business income tax paid as a provincial or 
territorial foreign tax credit. However, under section 110.5, 
you can increase taxable income so as to claim an otherwise 
non-deductible foreign business income tax credit. See 
Line 355 on page 74 for details. 
To claim this credit, complete Part 2 of Schedule 21.

Line 652 – Investment tax credit 
A corporation can claim an investment tax credit (ITC) to 
reduce Part I tax that it would otherwise have to pay, or in 
some cases this credit may be fully or partially refundable. 
Use Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, to 
calculate the ITC. 
A corporation earns ITCs by applying a specified 
percentage to the cost of acquiring certain property 
(investments) or on certain expenditures. However, you 
first have to reduce the capital cost of the property or the 
expenditure by any government or non-government 
assistance you received or will receive for that property or 
the expenditure. Any goods and services tax/harmonized 
sales tax (GST/HST) input tax credit or rebate received for 
property acquired is considered government assistance. 
On page 2 of Schedule 31, you will find a list of the 
percentages you have to apply to eligible investments and 
expenditures. 
Available-for-use rule 
A corporation is not considered to have acquired a property 
or made capital expenditures for earning an investment tax 
credit until the property becomes available for use. 
For more information about the available-for-use rule, see 
“When is property available for use?” on page 46. 
References 
Subsections 13(26) to 13(32) and 127(11.2) 
Investments and expenditures that qualify for an ITC 
The following investments and expenditures earn an ITC: 
A. the cost of acquiring qualified property 
A.1 the cost of acquiring qualified resource property (only 
carry-forward amounts are allowed) 
B. SR&ED qualified expenditure pool 
C. pre-production mining expenditures (only 
carry-forward amounts are allowed) 
D. apprenticeship expenditures 
E. eligible child care space expenditures (only 
carry-forward amounts are allowed) 
Note 
For clean economy ITCs, see Line 780 on page 135. 
The following are definitions of investments and 
expenditure that qualify for an ITC: 
A. Qualified property is defined in subsection 127(9). It 
includes new prescribed buildings, prescribed 
machinery, and equipment or prescribed energy and 
conservation property acquired during the year to use 
in certain activities in Newfoundland and Labrador, 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, 
the Gaspé Peninsula, and prescribed offshore regions 
(Atlantic region). 
A.1 Qualified resource property is defined in 
subsection 127(9). You can no longer file a claim for this 
credit, since it expired December 31, 2015, and 
transitional measures expired December 31, 2016. Only 
unused credits that have not expired can be carried 
forward for up to 20 tax years following the tax year in 
which you made the investment. 
B. Qualified expenditure and SR&ED qualified 
expenditure pool are defined in subsection 127(9). 
Scientific research and experimental development is 
defined in subsection 248(1). 
C. Pre-production mining expenditure is defined in 
subsection 127(9). You can no longer file a claim for this 
credit, since it expired December 31, 2015, and so did 
transitional measures. Only unused credits that have 
not expired can be carried forward for up to 20 tax 
years that follow the tax year in which you made the 
investment. 
D. Apprenticeship expenditure is defined in 
subsection 127(9). 
E. Eligible child care space expenditure was defined in 
subsection 127(9) (the definition has been repealed). 
You can no longer file a claim for this credit, since it 
expired March 31, 2017, and transitional measures 
expired December 31, 2019. Only unused credits that 
have not expired can be carried forward for up to 20 tax 
years following the tax year in which you made the 
investment. 
ITC for qualified property 
You can earn ITCs on qualified property acquired mainly 
for use in designated activities in the Atlantic region. 
Designated activities include, among others, the following: 
■ manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease 
Note 
Eligible machinery and equipment acquired after 2015 
and before 2026 for use in Canada mainly for the 
manufacturing and processing of goods for sale or lease 
is included in class 53. These assets are qualified 
property for the ITC. 
■ logging 
■ farming or fishing 
■ storing grain 
■ harvesting peat 
The ITC rate for qualified property is 10%. 
In addition, the following rules apply to certain 
corporations that lease qualified properties such as 
prescribed machinery and equipment or prescribed energy 
generation and conservation property to lessees who use 
the property in any of the designated activities: 
■ For a corporation with a principal business of leasing 
property, lending money, or purchasing conditional sales 
contracts, accounts receivable, or other obligations, 
property acquired for the purposes of leasing it in the 
ordinary course of carrying on business in Canada is 
considered qualified property. 
■ For a corporation with a principal business of 
manufacturing property that it sells or leases, a property 
is considered qualified property only if the corporation

manufactures it and leases it in the ordinary course of its 
business in Canada. 
■ For a corporation with a principal business of selling 
or servicing property, a property is considered qualified 
property only if it is a type of property that the 
corporation sells or services, and the property is leased in 
the ordinary course of carrying on business in Canada. 
Scientific research and experimental development 
(SR&ED) qualified expenditure pool 
You have to file Form T661, Scientific Research and 
Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim, 
along with Schedule 31 when making a claim for an ITC 
on qualified expenditures for SR&ED. See page 65 for 
more information. 
Note 
You have to identify qualified SR&ED expenditures on 
Form T661 and Schedule 31 no later than 12 months after 
the filing due date for the year the expenditures were 
incurred (without reference to subsection 78(4)). 
The SR&ED qualified expenditure pool includes qualified 
SR&ED expenditures, that is current expenditures the 
corporation incurred in the year, plus or minus 
adjustments, plus any qualified expenditures transferred to 
the corporation under an agreement as outlined in 
subsection 127(13), less any qualified expenditures 
transferred by the corporation under such an agreement. 
For an agreement under subsection 127(13), see 
Form T1146, Agreement to Transfer Qualified Expenditures 
Incurred in Respect of SR&ED Contracts Between Persons Not 
Dealing at Arm’s Length.

SR&ED investment tax credit and refund 
You may earn a non-refundable ITC of 15% of the SR&ED 
qualified expenditure pool at the end of the tax year. 
Some CCPCs may earn the enhanced ITC at the rate of 35% 
on the SR&ED qualified expenditure pool, up to their 
expenditure limit. 
The expenditure limit is $3 million and is subject to a 
phase-out based on the taxable capital employed in Canada 
of the CCPC and its associated corporations for the 
previous tax year. The limit begins to decrease when this 
capital reaches $10 million and becomes nil at $50 million 
and higher. 
The Government announced that, for tax years that begin 
on or after December 16, 2024: 
■ the expenditure limit would increase from $3 million to 
$4.5 million 
■ the phase-out thresholds would increase from 
$10 million and $50 million, to $15 million and 
$75 million, respectively. CCPCs would have the option 
to have their annual expenditure limit determined based 
on gross revenue instead of taxable capital 
■ the enhanced refundable SR&ED credit would be 
extended to Canadian public corporations. However, 
unlike CCPCs: 
– the $15 million and $75 million phase-out thresholds 
would be based on the corporation’s gross revenue 
over the prior three years instead of its taxable capital 
for the preceding year 
– qualifying expenditures in excess of an eligible 
Canadian public corporation’s annual expenditure 
limit would not be eligible for a partially refundable 
SR&ED ITC 
For property acquired after December 15, 2024 (or lease 
costs first becoming payable after that date) the pre-2014 
eligibility of capital expenditures would be reinstated to 
both the SR&ED income deduction and the SR&ED ITC. 
Qualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC would 
be entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate 
of 40% on their capital expenditures. 
If the corporation is associated with one or more CCPCs, 
you have to allocate the expenditure limit among the 
associated CCPCs on Schedule 49, Agreement Among 
Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate 
the Expenditure Limit. See page 34 for details about 
Schedule 49. 
CCPCs that do not meet the definition of qualifying 
corporation can earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on 
qualified SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure 
limit. This ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the 
year to offset Part I tax. The ITC earned on SR&ED 
expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is earned at 
the rate of 15% and it is not refundable. 
A qualifying corporation is a CCPC whose taxable income 
for the previous tax year before the application of the 
specified future tax consequences plus the taxable incomes 
of all associated corporations before the application of the 
specified future tax consequences (for tax years ending in 
the same calendar year as the corporation’s previous tax 
year) is not more than the total of the qualifying income 
limits of the corporation and the associated corporations for 
those previous years. 
The qualifying income limit is $500,000. It begins to 
decrease when the total taxable capital employed in Canada 
of the corporation and its associated corporations for the 
previous tax year reaches $10 million and becomes nil at 
$50 million. 
CCPCs that meet the definition of qualifying corporation 
can also earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified 
SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure limit. This 
ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the year to offset 
Part I tax. For qualifying corporations, the ITC earned on 
SR&ED expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is 
earned at the rate of 15%, of which 40% is also refundable. 
Corporations may be associated because the same group of 
persons controls them, but the members of this group do 
not act together and have no other connection to each other. 
CCPCs that are associated only because of the above 
definition of a group will not be considered associated for 
the following calculations: 
■ the refundable ITC on eligible SR&ED expenditures 
■ calculating the expenditure limit 
■ allocating the expenditure limit

Apprenticeship job creation tax credit 
A corporation can earn a non-refundable ITC equal to 10% 
of the eligible salaries and wages paid to eligible 
apprentices employed in the business in the tax year to a 
maximum credit of $2,000, per year, per apprentice. 
An eligible apprentice is one who is working in a 
prescribed trade in the first 24 months of their 
apprenticeship contract. This contract is registered with 
Canada or a province or territory under an apprenticeship 
program designed to certify or license individuals in the 
trade. 
A prescribed trade will include the trades currently listed 
as Red Seal Trades. For more information about the trades, 
go to red-seal.ca. Also, the minister of Finance may in 
consultation with the minister of Employment and Social 
Development, prescribe other trades. 
Eligible salaries and wages are those payable by the 
employer to an eligible apprentice for the apprentices’ 
employment in Canada in the tax year and during the first 
24 months of the apprenticeship. Eligible salaries or wages 
do not include qualified expenditures incurred by the 
corporation in a tax year, remuneration based on profits, 
bonuses, taxable benefits including stock options, and 
certain unpaid remuneration. 
Where two or more related employers employ an 
apprentice, special rules apply to ensure that the $2,000 
limit is allocated to only one employer. 
An unused credit can be carried back 3 years and carried 
forward 20 years. 
Complete parts 19 to 21 of Schedule 31 to calculate the 
credit. 
Investment tax credit (ITC) for child care spaces 
Note 
You can no longer earn this credit. It was eliminated for 
expenditures made after March 21, 2017, and so was the 
transitional measure for eligible expenditures incurred 
before 2020 under a written agreement entered into 
before March 22, 2017. You can only carry forward the 
non-refundable, unused, unexpired credit for 20 tax 
years. 
To claim the carryforward, complete parts 22 and 23 of 
Schedule 31. 
The credit will be added to the taxpayer’s tax otherwise 
payable under Part I of the Act if, at any time within the 
60 months of the day on which the taxpayer acquired the 
property: 
■ the new child care space is no longer available, or 
■ property that was an eligible expenditure for this credit is 
sold or leased to another person or converted to another 
use 
For more information on the recapture, see Line 602 on 
page 83. 
Investment tax credit (ITC) claim 
You can deduct the full amount of ITC against federal Part I 
tax payable. If you are claiming an ITC for a depreciable 
property, reduce the capital cost of the property in the next 
tax year by the amount of this year’s ITC. For more 
information, see Schedule 8, “Column 3 – Cost of 
acquisitions during the year”, on page 49. 
If you are claiming an SR&ED ITC to reduce tax payable or 
to receive a refund, you have to reduce the pool of 
deductible SR&ED expenditures in the next tax year. For 
more information see Line 435 in Guide T4088, Scientific 
Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) 
Expenditures Claim – Guide to Form T661. 
Note 
A corporation cannot claim an ITC for an expense or 
expenditure incurred in the course of earning income 
if any of that income is exempt income or is exempt from 
tax under Part I. 
References 
Subsections 13(7.1), 37(1), and 127(5) 
You can carry forward certain ITCs not previously 
deducted for 20 years, or carry them back 3 years, to reduce 
Part I tax. Remember that you can only carry back ITCs to a 
prior year if you cannot deduct them in the year you earn 
them. 
Special rules restrict the carryforward and carryback of 
ITCs following an acquisition of control.

Summary of tax and credits 
In the “Summary of tax and credits” area of your return, 
summarize the amounts of federal and provincial or 
territorial tax payable, as well as the credits and refunds 
claimed to reduce total tax payable. 
Federal tax 
Line 700 – Part I tax payable 
On line 700, enter the amount of Part I tax payable that you 
determined at amount N of page 8. 
Line 705 – Part II.2 tax payable 
For transactions that occur after 2023, a 2% tax on 
repurchases of equity applies (subject to certain exceptions) 
on the net value of all equity repurchases during the year 
by: 
■ a corporation resident in Canada (other than a mutual 
fund corporation) whose shares are listed on a 
designated stock exchange at any time in the tax year 
■ a trust whose units are listed on a designated stock 
exchange at any time in the tax year and that is one of the 
following: 
– a real estate investment trust 
– a specified investment flow-through (SIFT) trust 
■ a partnership where the partnership unit is listed on a 
designated stock exchange at any time in the tax year and 
that is a SIFT partnership 
■ publicly traded entities that would be SIFT trusts or SIFT 
partnerships if their assets were located in Canada 
The tax does not apply to an entity described above in a tax 
year if the total fair market value of equity that is 
redeemed, acquired, or cancelled in that tax year (prorated 
for short tax years) is less than $1 million. 
Use Schedule 56, Part II.2 Tax on repurchases of equity, to 
calculate any Part II.2 tax payable and file it with your 
T2 return. A penalty applies for late filing of Schedule 56 in 
addition to the penalty applicable to late filing of the 
T2 Return. 
On line 705, enter the amount of Part II.2 tax payable that 
you determined at amount G of Schedule 56. 
Line 710 – Part III.1 tax payable 
A corporation that designates dividends as eligible 
dividends that exceed its capacity to pay such dividends is 
subject to Part III.1 tax. The tax is equal to 20% of the 
excessive eligible dividend designation. 
Use Schedule 55, Part III.1 Tax on Excessive Eligible Dividend 
Designations, to calculate any Part III.1 tax payable and file 
it with your T2 return. 
Note 
Every corporation resident in Canada that pays a taxable 
dividend in the year, other than a capital gains dividend, 
must file this schedule. 
In the case where an excessive eligible dividend 
designation is determined to be part of a tax avoidance 
scheme, the 20% tax plus an additional 10% tax will apply 
to the whole dividend designation. 
Eligible dividend 
An eligible dividend is any taxable dividend paid to a 
resident of Canada by a Canadian corporation that is 
designated by that corporation to be an eligible dividend. 
The corporation does the designation by notifying, in 
writing, each person or partnership at the time it pays them 
the dividend. For more information about the notification 
guidelines, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends and 
select “Designation of eligible dividends.” 
A corporation is allowed to designate a portion of a taxable 
dividend (rather than the whole amount) to be an eligible 
dividend. Late designations are allowed, if they are made 
within three years, or in some situations, six years, after the 
day on which the designation was first required to be made 
and, in the opinion of the minister, it is just and equitable to 
do so (including to affected shareholders) in the 
circumstances. The designation is deemed to have been 
made on the day the designation was required to be made. 
A corporation’s capacity to pay eligible dividends depends 
mostly on its status. 
General rate income pool (GRIP) 
A CCPC or a deposit insurance corporation may pay 
eligible dividends to the extent of its GRIP—a balance 
generally reflecting taxable income that has not benefited 
from the small business deduction or any other special tax 
rate—without incurring Part III.1 tax. The GRIP is 
calculated at the end of the tax year. However, a 
corporation can pay eligible dividends over the course of 
the year as long as, at the end of the year, the eligible 
dividends paid do not exceed its GRIP. 
Use Schedule 53, General Rate Income Pool (GRIP) 
Calculation, to determine the GRIP and file it with your 
T2 return. You should file this schedule if you paid an 
eligible dividend in the tax year, or if your GRIP balance 
changed, to ensure that the GRIP balance on CRA’s records 
is correct. 
You can view GRIP balances using the “View return 
balances” service through: 
■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are the business owner 
■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
Low rate income pool (LRIP) 
A corporation resident in Canada that is neither a CCPC 
nor a deposit insurance corporation can pay eligible 
dividends in any amount unless it has an LRIP. 
Note 
For tax years starting after April 6, 2022, the investment 
income earned by substantive CCPCs will be added to 
their LRIP so that distributions of such income will not 
entitle the shareholders to the enhanced dividend tax 
credit.



=== 第 95 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
95
The LRIP is generally made up of taxable income that has 
benefited from certain preferential tax rates. The 
corporation has to reduce its LRIP to zero by paying out 
ordinary dividends before it can pay an eligible dividend, 
or it will be subject to Part III.1 tax. The LRIP must be 
calculated at the time a dividend is paid or received or any 
other event occurs affecting the LRIP balance in the year. 
Use Schedule 54, Low Rate Income Pool (LRIP) Calculation, to 
determine the LRIP, throughout the year. File the 
completed schedule with your T2 return. All other 
calculations including the worksheets should be kept with 
your records in case the CRA asks for them at a later date. 
Election not to be a Canadian-controlled private 
corporation 
A CCPC can elect not to be a CCPC for purposes of the 
eligible dividend treatment. If it so elects, it is deemed not 
to be a CCPC for the tax year in which it makes the election 
and all later tax years, until it revokes the election. The 
CCPC will lose its entitlement to the small business 
deduction. However, no other benefits of CCPC status will 
be affected. 
A corporation that revokes an election will become a CCPC 
again for the tax year that follows the tax year in which the 
revocation is made. 
Use Form T2002, Election, or Revocation of an Election, not to 
Be a Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation, to make or to 
revoke an election previously made, and file it by the due 
date of the T2 return. The CRA will not accept an election 
or revocation of an election after the filing due date. 
Note 
A corporation that has previously revoked an election 
must get written consent from the CRA to make or 
revoke another election. 
Election to treat excessive eligible dividend 
designations as ordinary dividends 
Corporations that make excessive eligible dividend 
designations may be allowed to elect to treat the excessive 
amounts paid as ordinary dividends. In order to do so, the 
corporation must have the concurrence of its shareholders 
who received, or were entitled to receive, the dividend and 
whose addresses are known to the corporation. For more 
information, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends and 
select “Election to treat excessive eligible dividend 
designations as ordinary dividends.” 
Corporations cannot elect to treat excessive eligible 
dividend designations that are subject to the 30% Part III.1 
tax as ordinary dividends.

Line 712 – Part IV tax payable 
Use Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable 
Dividends Paid, and Part IV Tax Calculation, to calculate 
Part IV tax payable on taxable dividends you received. 
Dividends subject to Part IV tax 
The following types of dividends are subject to Part IV tax: 
■ taxable dividends from corporations that are deductible 
under section 112 when you calculate taxable income 
■ taxable dividends from foreign affiliates that are 
deductible under paragraphs 113(1)(a), (a.1) (b), or (d), or 
subsection 113(2) when you calculate taxable income 
Note 
For details about dividends received after 2023 by 
financial institutions on shares that are mark-to-market 
property, see Line 320 on page 72. 
Taxable dividends received are only subject to Part IV tax 
if the corporation receives them while it is a private or 
subject corporation. Taxable dividends received from a 
non-connected corporation are subject to Part IV tax at a 
rate of 38 1/3%. 
Taxable dividends received from a connected corporation 
are subject to Part IV tax only when paying the dividends 
generates a dividend refund for the payer corporation. 
Definitions 
Private corporation 
A private corporation is a corporation that is: 
■ resident in Canada 
■ not a public corporation 
■ not controlled by one or more public corporations 
(other than a prescribed venture capital corporation) 
■ not controlled by one or more prescribed federal Crown 
corporations 
■ not controlled by any combination of prescribed federal 
Crown corporations and public corporations 
Reference 
Subsection 89(1) 
Subject corporation 
A subject corporation is a corporation, other than a private 
corporation, that is resident in Canada and is controlled by 
or for the benefit of either an individual other than a trust, 
or a related group of individuals other than trusts. 
Reference 
Subsection 186(3) 
Connected corporation 
A payer corporation is connected to the corporation that 
receives the dividends (the recipient) if the recipient 
controls the payer corporation. The payer and recipient 
corporations are also connected when both of the following 
apply: 
■ the recipient owns more than 10% of the issued share 
capital (with full voting rights) of the payer corporation 
■ the recipient owns shares of the capital stock of the payer 
corporation with a fair market value of more than 10% of 
the fair market value of all the issued share capital of the 
payer corporation 
You determine control of the corporation by considering 
the actual ownership of shares, without taking into account 
any rights referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b). 
For purposes of Part IV tax, a payer corporation is 
controlled by a recipient corporation if more than 50% of

the payer’s issued share capital (having full voting rights) 
belongs to the recipient, to persons with whom the 
recipient does not deal at arm’s length, or to any 
combination of these persons.

Exempt corporations 
The following types of corporations are exempt from 
Part IV tax: 
A. a corporation that was bankrupt at any time during the 
year 
B. a corporation that, throughout the year, was one of the 
following: 
– a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital 
corporation 
– a prescribed investment contract corporation 
– an insurance corporation 
– a corporation licensed as a trustee 
– a bank 
– a registered securities dealer that was, throughout the 
year, a member of a designated stock exchange in 
Canada 
Reference 
Section 186.1 
Exempt dividends 
A corporation that is a prescribed venture capital 
corporation throughout the year does not have to pay 
Part IV tax on dividends it received from a prescribed 
qualifying corporation. 
References 
Section 186.2 
Regulation 6704 
Dividends not taxable 
Any dividends that a corporation received from a capital 
dividend account are not taxable, as long as the payer 
corporation made an election under section 83. Therefore, if 
these non-taxable dividends are included as income, they 
should be deducted as an adjustment on Schedule 1. 
Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3 
In the following section you will find details on Parts 1 
and 2 of Schedule 3. Parts 3 and 4 are explained on page 82. 
Part 1 – Dividends received in the tax year 
Complete Part 1 to identify dividends, both taxable and 
non-taxable, received during the tax year and to calculate 
Part IV tax before deductions. Public corporations (other 
than subject corporations) do not need to calculate Part IV 
tax. 
Note 
If more than one corporation paid dividends, you have 
to do a separate calculation for each payer corporation. If 
your corporation’s tax year-end is different than that of 
the payer corporation, dividends could have been 
received from more than one tax year of the payer 
corporation. If so, use a separate line to provide the 
information according to each tax year of the payer 
corporation. 
On line 320 of the return, enter the amount of taxable 
dividends deductible from taxable income under 
section 112, subsections 113(2) and 138(6), and 
paragraphs 113(1)(a), (a.1), (b), or (d). 
Part 2 – Calculation of Part IV tax payable 
Part IV tax otherwise payable on a dividend is reduced by 
any amount of Part IV.1 tax payable on the same dividend. 
See below for details. 
You can reduce the amount of dividends subject to Part IV 
tax by using non-capital losses and farm losses incurred in 
the tax year or carried forward from previous years. 
Part 2 also allows the calculation of Part IV tax payable for 
taxable dividends received from connected corporations 
and eligible dividends received from non-connected 
corporations. 
On line 712 of the return, enter the amount of Part IV tax 
payable on taxable dividends received.

Complete Schedule 43, Calculation of Parts IV.1 and VI.1 
Taxes, to calculate Part IV.1 tax payable. 
Part 4 of Schedule 43 – Calculation of Part IV.1 tax 
payable 
Part 4 gives details on how to calculate Part IV.1 tax. 
Public corporations and certain other corporations may be 
subject to the 10% Part IV.1 tax on dividends they receive 
on taxable preferred shares. A restricted financial 
institution is also subject to tax on dividends received 
on taxable restricted financial institution shares 
(see subsection 248(1) for definitions of these terms). 
The issuer of taxable preferred shares can elect to pay 
a 40% rather than a 25% tax under Part VI.1 on dividends 
on taxable preferred shares when they complete Part 3 of 
this schedule. This election exempts the holder of these 
shares from the 10% tax under Part IV.1. No other form 
needs to be filed to elect. For details, see Line 724 on 
page 97. 
Excepted dividends, which are defined in section 187.1, 
are not subject to Part IV.1 tax. For example, an excepted 
dividend is one the corporation receives on a share of 
another corporation in which the corporation had a 
substantial interest at the time it received the dividend. 
Part 4 of the schedule also allows the calculation of Part IV 
tax reduction when there is Part IV.1 tax payable on the 
same dividend. 
The Part IV tax reduction is equal to: 
■ 10% of the dividend, if the dividend is received from a 
non-connected corporation 
■ 30% of the Part IV tax payable, if the dividend is received 
from a connected corporation

Line 720 – Part VI tax payable 
You have to complete Schedule 38, Part VI Tax on Capital of 
Financial Institutions, to calculate Part VI tax. 
Part VI levies a tax on a financial institution’s taxable 
capital employed in Canada. Part VI tax is 1.25% of the 
taxable capital employed in Canada that is more than the 
$1 billion capital deduction for the year. 
If the corporation is a member of a related group, you have 
to allocate the capital deduction among the members. 
Use Schedule 39, Agreement Among Related Financial 
Institutions – Part VI Tax, to allocate the capital deduction. 
File this agreement with your return. 
Note 
Only one of the associated or related corporations needs 
to file Schedule 39 for a calendar year. However, if 
Schedule 39 is not already on file when the CRA assesses 
any of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar 
year of the agreement, it will ask for one. 
Under subsection 190.1(3), you can deduct Part I tax 
payable for the year from Part VI tax payable. This is called 
the Part I tax credit. You can deduct any unused Part I tax 
credits from Part VI tax in any of the three previous and 
seven following tax years. 
To calculate the balance of unused Part I tax credits and to 
carry back this credit, you can use Schedule 42, Calculation 
of Unused Part I Tax Credit. 
Financial institutions include banks, trust companies, life 
insurance corporations, certain holding corporations, and 
corporations that accept deposits and carry on the business 
of lending money on the security of real property or 
immovables, or investing in indebtedness on the security of 
mortgages on real property or of hypothecs on immovables. 
File Schedule 38 with your return if you have Part VI tax 
payable, or would have, if not for the deduction of a Part I 
tax credit. 
On line 720, enter the amount of Part VI tax payable that 
you calculated on line 890 of Schedule 38.

Complete the following schedules if required: 
■ Schedule 43, Calculation of Parts IV.1 and VI.1 Taxes 
■ Schedule 45, Agreement Respecting Liability for 
Part VI.1 Tax 
See the following headings for more details 
Part 1 of Schedule 43 – Calculation of dividend 
allowance 
Calculate the dividend allowance on Part 1 of Schedule 43. 
Generally, the first $500,000 of dividends paid in the year 
on taxable preferred shares is exempt from Part VI.1 tax 
liability. This basic annual exemption is called the dividend 
allowance. 
However, the $500,000 dividend allowance is reduced if 
you paid more than $1 million of dividends on taxable 
preferred shares in the previous year. 
Part 2 of Schedule 43 – Agreement among associated 
corporations to allocate the dividend allowance 
If you are a member of an associated group, you have to 
allocate the dividend allowance between the members. 
Part 2 provides an area for this allocation. 
Part 3 of Schedule 43 – Calculation of Part VI.1 tax 
payable 
Complete Part 3 of Schedule 43 to calculate Part VI.1 tax. 
Part VI.1 tax is levied on dividends (other than certain 
excluded dividends) you paid on short-term preferred 
shares and taxable preferred shares. 
You are subject to a 40% tax on dividends you paid on 
short-term preferred shares that are more than the annual 
dividend allowance. 
You are subject to a tax of 25% or 40% on dividends you 
paid on taxable preferred shares (other than short-term 
preferred shares) that are more than any remaining 
dividend allowance. Choosing the 40% rate will exempt the 
holder of these shares from the 10% tax under Part IV.1. 
This rate would apply to all future dividends paid on that 
class or series of shares. 
See subsection 248(1) for definitions of the terms short-term 
preferred shares and taxable preferred shares. 
Schedule 45, Agreement Respecting Liability for 
Part VI.1 Tax 
Complete Schedule 45 to certify the transfer of Part VI.1 tax 
liability and send it to the CRA with Schedule 43. 
A corporation (the transferor) can transfer all or part of its 
Part VI.1 tax liability to another corporation (the transferee), 
if the corporations were related throughout the following 
tax years: 
■ the transferor’s tax year for which it owes Part VI.1 tax

IT-137, Additional Tax on Certain Corporations Carrying on Business in Canada 
Provincial and territorial tax 
Quebec and Alberta administer their own corporation 
income tax systems. Corporations that earn income in these 
provinces have to file separate provincial corporation 
income tax returns. 
All other provinces and territories legislate their 
corporation income tax provisions, but the CRA 
administers them. These provinces and territories do not 
charge income tax on the taxable income of corporations 
that are exempt from tax under section 149. 
If the corporation has a permanent establishment in any 
province or territory other than Quebec or Alberta, you 
have to calculate provincial and/or territorial income taxes 
and credits, as well as federal income taxes and credits, on 
the return. 
Note 
Unless otherwise specified in the legislation, the credits 
are considered government assistance and must be 
included in income in the tax year they are received. 
Reference 
Paragraph 12(1)(x) 
Permanent establishment 
A permanent establishment in a province or territory is 
usually a fixed place of business of the corporation, which 
includes an office, branch, oil well, farm, timberland, 
factory, workshop, warehouse, or mine. Each corporate 
partner in a partnership has a permanent establishment 
where the partnership has a fixed place of business. If the 
corporation does not have a fixed place of business, the 
corporation’s permanent establishment is the principal 
place in which the corporation’s business is conducted. 
Each member of a partnership has a permanent 
establishment in the province or territory where the 
partnership has a permanent establishment. This applies to 
both general and limited partners. For example, where a 
corporation or its partnership uses substantial machinery or 
equipment in a particular place at any time in a tax year, it 
is deemed to have a permanent establishment in that place. 
Review the locations in which your activities and 
transactions occur to ensure all permanent establishments 
are properly identified. 
If the corporation carries on business, including partnership 
business, through an employee or an agent established in a 
particular place, it is considered to have a permanent 
establishment in that place if the employee or agent: 
■ has general authority to contract for the corporation, or 
■ has a stock of merchandise owned by the corporation 
from which the employee or agent regularly fills orders 
received 
A corporation that would not otherwise have any 
permanent establishment in a province or territory and/or 
a jurisdiction outside of Canada is deemed to have a 
permanent establishment at the place designated in its 
incorporation documents or bylaws as its head office or 
registered office. So, whether or not the corporation carries 
on a business in a province or territory, it is entitled to the 
10% federal abatement, but subject to provincial or 
territorial taxation. 
See Regulation 400(2) for a complete definition of 
permanent establishment.

The following section explains when and how to complete 
Schedule 5. 
Schedule 5, Tax Calculation Supplementary – 
Corporations 
You have to complete Schedule 5 if one of the following 
applies: 
■ there is a permanent establishment of the corporation or 
its partnerships in more than one province or territory 
(complete Part 1), whether or not you are taxable (if 
taxable, also complete Part 2) 
■ the corporation is claiming provincial or territorial tax 
credits, or rebates (complete Part 2) 
■ the corporation has to pay taxes other than income tax 
(see “Part 2 of Schedule 5” on page 100) 
Note 
The Newfoundland and Labrador offshore area and the 
Nova Scotia offshore area are considered provinces. 
For information on the calculation of tax for each province 
and territory, see the sections that follow in this chapter. 
Part 1 of Schedule 5 – Allocation of taxable income 
You must complete Part 1 of Schedule 5 if you or your 
partnerships had a permanent establishment in more than 
one province or territory. Complete columns A to F for each 
province or territory in which you had a permanent 
establishment in the tax year. If there is no taxable income, 
you only have to complete columns A, B and D. 
Note 
This also applies to corporations with permanent 
establishments in Quebec or Alberta. 
The CRA assesses provincial or territorial income taxes on 
the amount of taxable income allocated to each province or 
territory. For details on how to allocate taxable income, see 
Regulation 402 and Income Tax Folio S4-F3-C2, Provincial 
Income Allocation. 
Special rules for establishing a corporation’s gross revenue 
and salaries and wages attributable to a jurisdiction are 
provided in cases where the corporation is a member of a 
partnership and the partnership had permanent 
establishments in more than one jurisdiction. See 
Guide T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return 
(T5013 Forms), and prescribed Form T5013 SCH 5, Allocation 
of Salaries and Wages, and Gross Revenue for Multiple 
Jurisdictions – Schedule 5. 
Whether or not the partnership filed a T5013 and related 
schedules, the partner corporations must report their 
permanent establishments and allocable revenue and 
salaries and wages on their own Schedule 5, inclusive of 
their partnership allocations. If a partner has a 50% share of 
partnership income it must include 50% of the gross 
revenue from T5013 SCH 5 in its T2 SCH 5 gross revenue. 
Salaries and wages of the partnership should also be 
reported on the T2 SCH 5 in the same proportions. 
Generally, to allocate taxable income to each province or 
territory, you have to use a formula based on gross 
revenue, and salaries and wages. See Part 1 of Schedule 5 
for details. 
You will find the general rules on how to allocate gross 
revenue in Regulation 402. 
Do not include any of the following amounts in gross 
revenue: 
■ interest on bonds, debentures, or mortgages 
■ dividends on shares of capital stock 
■ rents or royalties from property that are not part of the 
principal business operations 
Allocate gross salaries and wages paid in the year to the 
permanent establishment in which those salaries and wages 
were paid only to the extent they were paid to employees of 
the permanent establishment (the permanent establishment 
is not necessarily the permanent establishment in which 
those salaries and wages were paid). Do not include in 
gross salaries and wages any commissions paid to a person 
who is not an employee, unless that person renders services 
that would normally be performed by an employee of the 
corporation. The allocation of salaries paid through a 
central paymaster is subject to the deeming rules under 
Regulation 402.1. 
See Regulations 403 to 413 for details on special methods 
for allocating taxable income for the following types of 
businesses: 
■ insurance corporations (Regulation 403) 
■ banks (Regulation 404) 
■ federal credit unions (Regulation 404.1) 
■ trust and loan corporations (Regulation 405) 
■ railway corporations (Regulation 406) 
■ airline corporations (Regulation 407) 
■ grain elevator operators (Regulation 408)

Note 
Corporations with a permanent establishment in Quebec 
or Alberta must complete the appropriate provincial 
corporation returns and schedules to report provincial 
tax and claim provincial credits and rebates. 
Corporations with a permanent establishment in Ontario 
must also complete Part 2 of Schedule 5 if one of the 
three previous or five following conditions applies. The 
corporation: 
■ is claiming the Ontario small business deduction 
■ is claiming the Ontario credit union reduction 
■ has an addition to Ontario basic income tax (such as a 
transitional tax debit) 
■ has Ontario corporate minimum tax payable 
■ has Ontario special additional tax on life insurance

return. When the result is negative, enter the refundable 
provincial or territorial tax credit on line 812 of the return. 
Attach to your return any forms you completed to claim 
provincial or territorial credits or rebates. 
In the following sections, you will find information about 
provincial and territorial tax rates, foreign tax credits, and 
details on the provincial and territorial credits and rebates. 
Dual rates of provincial and territorial 
income tax 
Generally, provinces and territories have two rates of 
income tax: the lower rate and the higher rate. 
The lower rate applies to the income eligible for the federal 
small business deduction. One component of the small 
business deduction is the business limit. Some provinces or 
territories choose to use the federal business limit. Others 
establish their own business limit. 
The higher rate applies to all other income. For detailed 
information on the income eligible for each rate and the 
rates that apply to each province and territory, see the 
sections that follow in this chapter or go to canada.ca/en 
/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics 
/corporations/corporation-tax-rates. 
Example 1 
Corp X earned all its income in 2024 from its permanent 
establishment in Newfoundland and Labrador. Corp X 
claimed the small business deduction when it calculated its 
federal tax payable. The income from active business 
carried on in Canada was $78,000. 
The Newfoundland and Labrador lower rate of tax is 2.5%. 
The higher rate of tax is 15%. 
Corp X calculates its Newfoundland and Labrador tax 
payable as follows: 
Taxable income 
$90,000 
Subtract amount taxed at lower rate: 
Least of lines 400, 405, 410, and 428 in the  
federal small business deduction calculation  
(from the T2 return) 
$78,000 
Amount taxed at higher rate 
$12,000 
Taxes payable at the lower rate: 
$78,000 × 2.5% =  
 
$ 1,950 
Taxes payable at the higher rate: 
$12,000 × 15% =  
 
$ 1,800 
Newfoundland and Labrador tax payable 
$ 3,750 
 
When you allocate taxable income to more than one 
province or territory, you also have to allocate 
proportionally any income eligible for the federal small 
business deduction. 
 
Example 2 
Corp Y has permanent establishments in both 
Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut. Its tax year 
runs from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. 
Corp Y claimed the small business deduction when it 
calculated its federal tax payable. 
The lower rate of tax for Newfoundland and Labrador 
is 2.5%, and the higher rate of tax is 15%. 
To calculate its Newfoundland and Labrador income tax, 
Corp Y does the following calculations:



=== 第 101 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
101 
Taxable income allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador 
(from Schedule 5) 
$60,000 
Taxable income allocated to Nunavut (from Schedule 5)
 
$30,000 
Total taxable income earned in Canada 
$90,000 
Least of lines 400, 405, 410, and 428 in the  
federal small business deduction calculation  
(from the T2 return) 
$78,000 
Income eligible for the federal small business 
deduction attributed to Newfoundland and Labrador: 
$60,000 × $78,000 = 
 
$52,000 
$90,000 
Taxable income earned in  
Newfoundland and Labrador 
$60,000 
Subtract: Income eligible for the federal small 
business deduction attributed to Newfoundland  
and Labrador 
$52,000 
Amount taxed at higher rate 
$ 8,000 
Taxes payable at higher rate: 
$8,000 × 15% = 
 
 
$ 1,200 
Taxes payable at lower rate: 
$52,000 × 2.5% =  
 
$ 1,300 
Newfoundland and Labrador tax payable 
$ 2,500 
To calculate its Nunavut income tax payable, Corp Y would 
repeat the same steps, using the rates that apply. 
 
On the appropriate lines of Part 2 of Schedule 5, enter the 
gross amount of each provincial or territorial tax payable. 
Provincial or territorial foreign tax credits 
Every province and territory allows a corporation to claim 
a foreign tax credit for taxes it paid to another country on 
foreign non-business income. This credit reduces the 
provincial tax otherwise payable. 
However, you cannot claim foreign tax credits for the 
provinces of Quebec and Alberta on the federal return 
because these provinces collect their own income taxes. 
The provincial or territorial foreign tax credit is available to 
a corporation that meets all of the following criteria: 
■ it is resident in Canada throughout the tax year 
■ it has a permanent establishment in the province or 
territory at any time in the tax year 
■ it has foreign investment income for the tax year 
For Ontario, an authorized foreign bank is eligible for the 
foreign tax credit if it performed Canadian banking 
business. 
You can claim this credit only if the foreign non-business 
income tax paid exceeds the federal foreign non-business 
income tax credit deductible for the year. 
For each province or territory for which you are claiming a 
credit, you have to do a separate calculation. Also, if you 
paid tax to more than one foreign country you have to do a 
separate calculation for each country. 
If dual rates of corporation tax apply, use the higher rate 
when you calculate the foreign tax credit. For Ontario, use 
the basic rate of tax. 
To claim the foreign tax credit, complete Schedule 21, 
Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits 
and Federal Logging Tax Credit. 
Note 
If the tax rate has changed during the tax year, you have 
to prorate the calculation in Part 9 of Schedule 21 using 
the number of days in each period. For British Columbia, 
prorate the tax rate in each period, round off the 
prorated rates to the nearest one-thousandth of 
one percent (= 0.001%), and add the rounded 
percentages for the periods before multiplying by the 
foreign non-business income. 
On the appropriate lines of Part 2 of Schedule 5, enter the 
applicable provincial and territorial foreign tax credits. 
Newfoundland and Labrador 
The lower rate of Newfoundland and Labrador income tax 
is 3%. This lower rate applies to taxable income earned in 
Newfoundland and Labrador that qualifies for the federal 
small business deduction. 
Effective January 1, 2024, the lower rate of income tax is 
decreased from 3% to 2.5%. If the rate changes during the 
tax year, you have to base your calculation on the number 
of days in the year that each rate is in effect. 
The higher rate of income tax is 15%. This higher rate 
applies to taxable income earned in Newfoundland and 
Labrador that does not qualify for the federal small 
business deduction. 
These rates also apply to taxable income earned in the 
Newfoundland and Labrador offshore area. 
You can use Schedule 307, Newfoundland and Labrador 
Corporation Tax Calculation, to help you calculate the 
Newfoundland and Labrador tax before the credits are 
applied. You do not have to file it with your return. See the 
schedule for more details. 
On line 200 and/or 205 of Schedule 5, enter the amount of 
tax calculated. 
Newfoundland and Labrador capital tax on financial 
institutions 
A provincial tax is levied on the taxable capital of a 
corporation that is a financial institution that has a 
permanent establishment in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
This tax applies to banks, as well as trust and loan 
corporations. 
The tax is equal to 6% of the amount by which the 
corporation’s taxable capital employed in the province for 
the year, including the offshore area, is more than its capital 
deduction for the year. 
A capital deduction of $5 million is available to a 
corporation if the total amount of the capital of the 
corporation and any corporations in a related group, if any,



=== 第 102 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
102 
is $10 million or less. If the corporation is a member of a 
related group that includes another financial institution, the 
corporation’s entitlement to the $5 million capital 
deduction could be subject to allocation by the province 
unless the corporation files an agreement allocating the 
capital deduction among the corporations in the related 
group. 
Use Schedule 306, Newfoundland and Labrador Capital Tax on 
Financial Institutions – Agreement Among Related 
Corporations, to allocate the capital deduction. File this 
agreement with your return. 
Corporations that are liable to pay this tax have to file 
Schedule 305, Newfoundland and Labrador Capital Tax on 
Financial Institutions. 
On line 518 of Schedule 5, enter the provincial tax on 
financial institutions payable. 
A penalty applies to financial institutions that have to pay 
this tax and do not file the required return on time. For 
details, see “Penalties” for large corporations on page 15. 
Instalment payment requirements for this tax are the same 
as for Part I tax. For details, see “Instalment due dates” on 
page 14. 
The provincial capital tax cannot be reduced by any tax 
credits. However, you can deduct the capital tax payable 
when calculating federal income for tax purposes. 
Newfoundland and Labrador political contribution 
tax credit 
You can claim a tax credit on contributions made to 
registered political parties, registered district associations, 
or registered non-affiliated candidates, as defined under the 
Elections Act, 1991, of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
The annual maximum credit is $500 and is calculated as 
follows: 
■ 75% of the first $100 contributed 
plus 
■ 50% of the next $450 contributed 
plus 
■ 33 1/3% of the next $600 contributed 
You do not have to file official receipts with your return. 
However, keep them in case the CRA asks for them later.

authorized foreign banks) as well as trust and loan 
companies. 
The tax is equal to 4% of the financial institution’s taxable 
capital employed in the province for the year, including the 
offshore area. 
When calculating its taxable capital (before allocation to the 
province), a financial institution can deduct a basic capital 
deduction plus the amount of its investment in related 
financial institutions for the tax year. 
For a tax year, a basic capital deduction of $5 million is 
available to a financial institution if the total amount of the 
capital of the financial institution and its related financial 
institutions, if any, is $10 million or less. If the financial 
institution is a member of a related group, the financial 
institution’s entitlement to the $5 million capital deduction 
could be deemed to be nil unless it files an agreement 
allocating the basic capital deduction among the group. 
The basic capital deduction is increased to $30 million if the 
financial institution is a trust company or a loan company 
with its registered office in Nova Scotia.

Ontario small business deduction 
The deduction reduces the Ontario basic income tax of a 
corporation that was a CCPC throughout the tax year. It is 
calculated by multiplying the corporation’s Ontario small 
business income for the tax year by the small business 
deduction rate (8.3%) for the year, resulting in a lower 
tax rate of 3.2%. 
The Ontario small business deduction is phased out for 
CCPCs (including associated corporations) with taxable 
capital employed in Canada of more than $10 million in the 
previous tax year. It is completely eliminated when the 
taxable capital is $50 million or more in the previous 
tax year. For tax years starting before April 7, 2022, the 
amount was $15 million. This is referred to as the taxable 
capital business limit reduction. 
The Ontario small business limit is not subject to the federal 
passive income business limit reduction. As such, eligible 
Ontario small businesses can receive the Ontario small 
business deduction regardless of the amount of passive 
income they earned. See page 78. 
Note 
Ontario small business income cannot exceed Ontario 
taxable income. 
When calculating the Ontario small business income, the 
corporation’s Ontario domestic factor is the ratio of the 
corporation’s Ontario taxable income to the corporation’s 
taxable income earned in all provinces and territories. 
You can use Part 2 of Schedule 500, Ontario Corporation Tax 
Calculation, to calculate the deduction. Schedule 500 is a 
worksheet and you do not have to file it with your return. 
On line 402 of Schedule 5, enter the small business 
deduction amount. 
Ontario transitional tax debits and credits 
The Ontario transitional tax debits and credits have 
provided a transition from the Corporations Tax Act 
(Ontario) for corporations with different income tax 
attributes for federal and Ontario purposes. 
For tax years ending before 2009, a corporation’s income 
and taxable income for Ontario purposes were determined 
based on its Ontario tax pools (for example, the 
undepreciated capital cost of depreciable property) under 
the Corporations Tax Act (Ontario). 
For tax years ending after 2008, the corporation’s income 
and taxable income for Ontario purposes are determined 
based on its federal tax pools under the Taxation Act, 2007 
(Ontario). 
If the corporation’s federal tax pools exceeded its Ontario 
tax pools, the corporation had a transitional tax debit. A 
specified corporation subject to the Ontario transitional tax 
debit was generally required to pay additional Ontario 
corporate income tax over a five-year period beginning 
with its first tax year ending after 2008. 
Although the five-year period has ended, it is still possible 
to have a transitional tax debit since, after 2015, the 
corporation can continue to defer the transitional tax debits 
as long as it does not claim an SR&ED tax deduction and 
the SR&ED expenditure pool is not reduced by government 
assistance. 
Conversely, where the corporation’s Ontario tax pools 
exceeded its federal tax pools, the corporation had a 
transitional tax credit. A specified corporation was 
generally entitled to a transitional tax credit over a five-year 
period beginning with its first tax year ending after 2008. 
You can no longer claim this credit. 
A specified corporation is defined under subsection 46(5) of 
the Taxation Act, 2007 (Ontario). 
Complete Schedule 506, Ontario Transitional Tax Debits and 
Credits, to calculate the corporation’s transitional tax debits. 
Use Schedule 507, Ontario Transitional Tax Debits and Credits 
Calculation, to determine the amounts to enter in Part 3 of 
Schedule 506. 
File Schedule 506 with the return. Schedule 507 does not 
have to be filed with the return. 
On line 276 of Schedule 5, enter the total transitional tax 
debits. 
Ontario corporate minimum tax 
The Ontario corporate minimum tax payable is equal to the 
amount by which the corporate minimum tax exceeds the 
Ontario corporate income tax. 
A corporation is subject to corporate minimum tax if its 
total assets are $50 million or more and its total revenue is 
$100 million or more except if the corporation was, 
throughout the tax year, one of the following: 
■ a corporation exempt from income tax under section 149 
of the federal Income Tax Act 
■ a mortgage investment corporation 
■ a deposit insurance corporation under 
subsection 137.1(5) of the federal Income Tax Act 
■ a congregation or business agency to which section 143 of 
the federal Income Tax Act applies 
■ an investment corporation 
■ a mutual fund corporation 
The corporate minimum tax rate is 2.7%. 
In determining if the total assets or total revenue exceeds 
the limits, a corporation must include its share of the total 
assets and total revenue of a partnership in which it has an 
interest, any associated foreign or Canadian corporation, 
and any associated corporation’s share of a partnership. 
If a corporation is associated it must complete and file 
Schedule 511, Ontario Corporate Minimum Tax – Total Assets 
and Revenue for Associated Corporations, to report the 
total assets and total revenue of all the associated 
corporations. 
File Schedule 510, Ontario Corporate Minimum Tax, with 
your T2 return if one of the following applies: 
■ the corporation is subject to corporate minimum tax for

in the year, but is deducting a corporate minimum tax 
credit or has a corporate minimum tax credit

■ the corporation has special additional tax on life 
insurance corporations payable in the year even if it is 
not subject to corporate minimum tax for the tax year 
(Part 4 of Schedule 510, and Schedule 512, Ontario Special 
Additional Tax on Life Insurance Corporations [SAT]) 
Corporate minimum tax is based on the adjusted net 
income of a corporation. The adjusted net income is a 
corporation’s net income calculated in accordance with 
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles or the 
International Financial Reporting Standards, with various 
adjustments. The adjustments are reported in Part 2 of 
Schedule 510. 
Accounting gains reported in the year from corporation 
reorganizations that are deferred for income tax purposes 
are deductible when calculating adjusted net income. 
Accounting gains reported in the year on the transfer of 
property under section 85, section 85.1, section 97, 
subsection 13(4), and/or section 44 of the federal Act are 
deductible when calculating adjusted net income. An 
election is required in order to claim this deduction. The 
CRA will consider a corporation to have filed an election 
(and to not need to file another document) if it reports the 
deduction and has filed the election(s) required for 
corporate income tax purposes. 
In addition, certain unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses 
and foreign currency gains/losses on assets that are not 
required to be included in computing income for income 
tax purposes are not included in adjusted net income. For 
additional information see Ontario Regulation 37/09.

applicable, Schedule 511.

Ontario special additional tax on life insurance 
corporations 
A life insurance corporation carrying on business in 
Ontario at any time in the tax year is subject to the Ontario 
special additional tax on life insurance corporations. 
The special additional tax payable for a tax year is equal to 
the amount by which: 
■ 1.25% of the corporation’s taxable paid-up capital 
multiplied by the number of days in the tax year divided 
by 365 
is more than 
■ the total of the corporation’s Ontario corporate income 
tax and corporate minimum tax payable for the year 
Use Schedule 512, Ontario Special Additional Tax on Life 
Insurance Corporations (SAT), to calculate the tax payable. 
The special additional tax paid for a tax year is added to the 
corporation’s corporate minimum tax credit carryforward. 
This credit may be deducted to reduce Ontario corporate 
income tax payable in future years. For more information, 
see “Ontario Corporate Minimum Tax Credit” on page 111. 
Enter the special additional tax payable for the tax year in 
Part 4 of Schedule 510, Ontario Corporate Minimum Tax. 
Life insurance corporations that are subject to the special 
additional tax and related, at the end of the tax year, to 
another life insurance corporation carrying on business in 
Canada must use Schedule 513, Agreement Among Related 
Life Insurance Corporations (Ontario), to allocate the capital 
allowance among the members of the related group. 
File Schedule 512 and, if applicable, Schedule 513, with

Ontario computer animation and special effects 
tax credit 
The Ontario computer animation and special 
effects (OCASE) tax credit is a refundable tax credit equal to 
18% of the qualifying labour expenditures for eligible 
computer animation and special effects activities, incurred 
by a qualifying corporation for an eligible production. 
Changes were made affecting the eligibility of productions 
for which the qualifying corporation did not incur any 
specified labour costs before March 26, 2024. See details 
below. 
Qualifying labour expenditures equal the corporation’s 
Ontario labour expenditures less any assistance reasonably 
related to these expenditures, other than excluded 
government assistance. For productions for which the 
qualifying corporation incurred any specified labour costs 
before March 26, 2024, qualifying labour expenditures must 
be incurred in the tax year. 
For productions for which the qualifying corporation did 
not incur any specified labour costs before March 26, 2024, 
qualifying labour expenditures may be incurred in the tax 
year or the previous tax year, so long as they were not 
claimed in the previous tax year. 
 The Ontario labour expenditures are the sum of the salaries 
and wages and the remuneration incurred that are directly 
attributable to computer animation and special effects 
activities performed in Ontario and paid to certain persons 
or entities, within 60 days of the end of the tax year. 
To be eligible for the credit, a corporation must meet certain 
criteria, including all of the following: 
■ be a Canadian corporation 
■ perform eligible computer animation and special effects 
activities for the eligible production at a permanent 
establishment in Ontario for the tax year 
Note 
Eligible labour expenditures may include remote work 
done by employees, if the work is done in Ontario and 
the employee is an Ontario resident who reports to and 
is under the direction of an eligible tax credit applicant 
with a permanent establishment in Ontario. 
■ not be exempt from tax under Part III of the Taxation 
Act, 2007 (Ontario) for the tax year 
■ not be controlled directly or indirectly, at any time in the 
tax year, in any way, by one or more corporations, all or 
part of whose taxable income is exempt from tax under 
section 57 of the Corporations Tax Act (Ontario) or 
Part III of the Taxation Act, 2007 (Ontario) 
■ not be a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital 
corporation at any time in the tax year 
For productions for which the qualifying corporation 
incurred any specified labour costs before March 26,2024, a 
certificate for the Ontario production services tax credit or 
the Ontario film and television tax credit must have been 
issued to a qualifying corporation in respect of the 
production. 
For film or television productions for which no specified 
labour costs were incurred before March 26, 2024, an 
eligible production no longer has to qualify for either the 
Ontario film and television tax credit or the Ontario 
production services tax credit. Instead, the corporation has 
to incur a minimum of $25,000 in Ontario labour 
expenditures for each film or television production it is 
claiming the OCASE credit for. This minimum labour 
expenditure threshold has to be incurred either: 
■ in the tax year of the claim 
■ cumulatively between the tax year of the claim and the 
previous tax year 
Once a qualifying corporation reaches the minimum labour 
expenditure threshold within up to two tax years for a 
specific production, expenditures related to that production 
in those tax years and any later tax year will be eligible. 
Certain types of productions are excluded from eligibility, 
such as instructional, music and gaming videos, and videos 
consisting mainly of user-generated footage. 
Before claiming the credit, you must apply online to 
Ontario Creates for a certificate of eligibility. If the 
production is eligible, Ontario Creates will issue a 
certificate indicating the estimated amount of the tax credit. 
Only one certificate of eligibility is issued for all of the 
eligible productions for the tax year. 
To claim the credit, file the following with your return for 
the year: 
■ a certificate of eligibility (or copy) issued by 
Ontario Creates 
■ a completed Schedule 554, Ontario Computer Animation 
and Special Effects Tax Credit, for each eligible production

The Ontario production services tax credit is a refundable 
tax credit based on qualifying production expenditures 
incurred for eligible film or television productions by a

Canadian or foreign owned. 
The credit is equal to 21.5% of qualifying production 
expenditures incurred, including qualifying labour 
expenditures as well as the purchase or rental of qualifying 
tangible properties, such as equipment and studio rentals. 
The qualifying production expenditures include the sum of: 
■ eligible wage expenditures 
■ eligible service contract expenditures 
■ eligible tangible property expenditures 
■ reimbursements to the parent company of eligible wage 
and service contract expenditures 
less 
■ assistance reasonably related to these expenditures (some 
exceptions apply—see next and Schedule 558) 
Effective November 15, 2022, expenditures for leasing real 
property in Ontario for on-location filming no longer must 
meet the “ordinarily engaged in” requirement for eligible 
tangible property expenditures. Expenditures must be 
reasonable in the circumstances and paid to an arm’s length 
party. The maximum eligible expenditures for leasing real 
property for on-location filming is 5% of the production’s 
qualifying production expenditures, net of these location 
costs. 
The eligible expenditures incurred in the tax year must be 
reasonable and directly attributable to the eligible 
production, performed in Ontario and paid to certain 
persons or entities, within 60 days of the end of the tax 
year. 
Ontario labour expenditures (including labour under a 
service contract) must amount to at least 25% of the total 
qualifying production expenditures. Otherwise, the 
corporation’s qualifying production expenditure limit for a 
tax year cannot be more than four times the Ontario labour 
expenditures (including labour under a service contract). 
Retroactive to June 4, 2015, eligible service contract 
expenditures included in determining a corporation’s 
expenditure limit must relate to remuneration paid by the 
corporation, rather than to salary and wages paid to 
Ontario‑based individuals. 
Expenditures incurred through non-arm’s length contracts 
are limited to expenditures that would have been eligible if 
incurred directly by the corporation. Only expenditures 
incurred after the final script stage to the end of the 
post-production stage are eligible for the credit. 
To be eligible for the credit, a corporation must meet certain 
criteria, including all of the following: 
■ be primarily engaged, in the tax year, in the carrying on 
of a film or video production business, or a film or video 
production services business, through a permanent 
establishment in Ontario 
■ not be exempt from tax, for the tax year, under Part III of 
the Taxation Act, 2007 (Ontario) or Part I of the Income 
Tax Act

from the printing of yearbooks, earned by the printer in the 
tax year and before 2025 
You can claim this credit if you are engaged in the business 
of printing books in Manitoba and have a permanent 
establishment in Manitoba. 
All of the following conditions apply: 
■ the maximum revenue is capped at $200,000 per book

Manitoba interactive digital media tax credit 
This permanent refundable tax credit is available to a 
corporation that incurs qualified labour expenditures, as 
well as some marketing and distribution expenses, towards 
the Manitoba-based development of eligible interactive 
digital media products for market. 
Effective April 1, 2023, the eligible expenditures were 
expanded to allow for more flexible forms of employee 
compensation and incentives as eligible labour 
expenditures for this tax credit. However, these do not 
include labour expenditures such as bonuses tied to profits 
or revenues, stock options or signing bonuses, which are 
still not eligible. 
To claim this credit, a corporation must first apply to 
Manitoba Economic Development, Investment, Trade, and 
Natural Resources for a certificate of eligibility. This 
certificate gives the corporation a preliminary indication as 
to whether the project will be eligible for the credit and an 
estimate of the final tax credit amount. The corporation 
must receive a certificate of eligibility before it can incur 
eligible expenses. 
The corporation must then apply for a tax credit certificate, 
which is used to claim a tax credit with the CRA. The 
corporation can apply for this certificate at: 
■ the end of every corporate tax year 
■ the end of the project 
However, if the corporation applies at the end of the 
project, only the expenses incurred in the current tax year, 
or the two years immediately preceding the current year, 
are eligible for a tax credit. 
Expenses for eligible projects are to be claimed in the tax 
year in which they were incurred. Some qualified 
corporations, in certain circumstances, will be exempt from 
having to apply for a certificate of eligibility (pre-approval) 
before project work starts. 
An eligible corporation must be a taxable Canadian 
corporation with a permanent establishment in Manitoba. 
The credit is equal to: 
■ 40% of eligible expenditures, if the corporation pays at 
least 25% of its total salary and wages to employees who 
are residents of Manitoba during the year the corporation 
incurred the eligible project expenses 
■ 35% of eligible expenditures, if the corporation pays less 
than 25% of its total salary and wages to Manitoba 
residents and it incurs at least $1 million in qualifying 
Manitoba labour expenses during the tax year related to 
its eligible projects, and provided that these expenses are 
not already supported by another form of government 
assistance 
Companies may claim up to $100,000 in eligible marketing 
and distribution expenses directly attributable to a project 
that meets the requirements to claim marketing and 
distribution costs. 
The eligible activities for this tax credit also include add-on 
digital media and content that is developed or provided 
mainly for commercial use and that complements the main 
product being developed, such as: 
■ downloadable content 
■ on-going maintenance and updates 
■ data management and analysis 
When a government or public authority purchases an 
interactive digital media product, the amount paid by the 
purchaser and the amount of the interactive digital media 
tax credit cannot be more than 100% of the project’s costs. 
Repaid or repayable government assistance and repayable 
or recoupable Canada Media Fund support do not reduce 
eligible labour costs. 
To claim the credit, file the tax credit certificate with your 
return no later than the filing due date for the tax year. 
The requirement that a corporation claim the credit on or 
before its filing due date for the tax year is eliminated. 
On line 614 of Schedule 5, enter the amount of the credit 
you are claiming.

British Columbia small business venture capital 
tax credit 
Corporations investing in shares of a registered venture 
capital corporation or eligible business corporation can 
claim a British Columbia venture capital tax credit. The 
British Columbia government issues a certificate called 
Form SBVC 10 to these corporations. 
Eligible business corporations participating in the small 
business venture capital program are allowed to claim the 
British Columbia interactive digital media tax credit 
(page 132). 
As of March 2, 2019, a convertible right investment in an 
eligible business corporation is eligible for a tax credit. 
A tax credit certificate is issued when the investment is 
made, not when the convertible right converts to shares. 
Apply the venture capital tax credit first to reduce the 
British Columbia provincial tax payable for the year to zero. 
If unclaimed credits remain, you can carry them forward 
for up to four tax years to reduce the British Columbia tax 
payable. 
You do not have to file the certificate with your return. 
However, keep it in case the CRA asks for it later. 
On Schedule 5, line 880, enter the unclaimed tax credit, if 
any, at the end of the previous tax year. On line 881, enter

employee because these credits are included in the 
calculation of the enhanced tax credits. An employer 
claiming the enhanced tax credit for a qualifying 
employee should only complete Part 3 when filing 
Schedule 428, British Columbia Training Tax Credit. The 
enhanced tax credits are as follows: 
– for the first 24 months of an eligible Red Seal

creation tax credit for the same employee 
– for the first 24 months of an eligible non-Red Seal 
program, 30% of the salary and wages (net of 
designated assistance) you paid to an employee who 
was in the first 24 months of a non-Red Seal 
apprenticeship program in the tax year. The maximum 
tax credit you can claim is $6,000 per employee. This 
credit is not available to Red Seal programs and cannot

Red Seal program, 22.5% of the salary and wages (net 
of designated assistance) you paid to an employee 
within the 12-month period ending on any day in the 
month that the employee completed level three or four. 
The maximum tax credit you can claim is $3,750, per 
employee who has completed level three and $4,500, 
per employee who has completed level four 
For the completion and enhanced tax credits, the salary and 
wages can be dually applied to overlapping periods when 
more than one level is completed during the tax year. 
Example 
The employer’s tax year runs from January 1 to 
December 31, 2024. 
An employee completes level three on January 31, 2024, 
and level four on June 30, 2024. 
In the tax year, the employer can claim the wages paid from 
February 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, for the level three tax 
credit. In the same tax year, the employer can also claim the 
wages paid from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, for the 
level four tax credit. The wages paid from July 1, 2023, to 
January 31, 2024, are used for both credits. 
 
You can also claim these credits for former qualified 
employees for the time they were employed by you during 
an eligible period, even though they were no longer 
working for you when they completed a specific level of the 
apprenticeship program. 
These credits extend to partnerships. Corporations who are 
members of a partnership, other than specified members 
(such as limited partners), can each claim their share of the 
partnership’s tax credit. 
Special rules apply for multiple employers not dealing at 
arm’s length who want to claim the training tax credit for

You can claim a refundable tax credit if you are an eligible 
employer in the British Columbia shipbuilding and ship 
repair industry and, before January 1, 2025, you paid salary 
and wages to an employee who was registered in a 
prescribed program administered through 
SkilledTradesBC. 
The British Columbia shipbuilding and ship repair industry 
tax credit, which was set to end December 31, 2024, is 
extended two years to December 31, 2026. 
The credit applies to Red Seal and non-Red Seal programs. 
You can claim one or more of the following three credits in 
the year for each qualified employee: 
■ the basic tax credit for employees within 24 months after 
the employee entered into an apprenticeship agreement 
(20%, maximum $5,250) 
■ the completion tax credit when an employee completes 
level three or four of an eligible program (20%, 
maximum $5,250) 
■ the enhanced tax credit for employees who are 
individuals registered under the Indian Act or who 
qualify for the disability amount on their income tax 
return (all levels of an eligible program) (30%, maximum 
$7,875) 
For each of the basic and completion tax credits, the credit 
is equal to 20% of the salary and wages (net of designated 
assistance) that were paid to an employee, up to a 
maximum of $5,250 per employee per tax year. 
These numbers are increased by half when they apply to 
the enhanced tax credit. This credit is equal to 30% of the 
salary and wages (net of designated assistance) that were 
paid to an employee, up to a maximum of $7,875 per 
employee per tax year. 
For the completion and enhanced tax credits, the salary and 
wages can be dually applied to overlapping periods when 
more than one level is completed during the tax year. 
You cannot claim the British Columbia shipbuilding and 
ship repair industry tax credit if you claim the British 
Columbia training tax credit in the tax year. 
These credits extend to partnerships. Corporations that are 
members of a partnership, other than specified members 
(such as limited partners), can each claim their share of the 
partnership’s tax credit.

Clean economy investment tax credits 
Investment tax credit for carbon capture, utilization, and 
storage (CCUS ITC) 
CCUS is a suite of technologies that capture carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion, industrial 
processes, or directly from the air, to either store the CO2 or 
use it in industry. Businesses that incur qualified CCUS 
expenditures after 2021 and before 2041 can claim the new 
refundable CCUS ITC. 
The credit rates for qualified CCUS expenditures are: 
■ 60% after 2021 (30% after 2030) for eligible capture 
equipment used in a direct air capture project 
■ 50% after 2021 (25% after 2030) for all other eligible 
capture equipment 
■ 37.5% after 2021 (18.75% after 2030) for eligible 
transportation, storage, and use equipment 
Effective November 28, 2023, businesses must elect to meet 
certain labour requirements – prevailing wage 
requirements and apprenticeship requirements. Otherwise, 
the credit rate will be reduced by 10 percentage points. 
Generally, you cannot claim the CCUS ITC if you claim one 
of the following credits for the same property: 
■ clean technology ITC 
■ clean hydrogen ITC 
■ clean technology manufacturing ITC 
■ ITCs in section 127 of the Income Tax Act (for example, 
the Atlantic ITC) 
■ clean electricity ITC 
Businesses may claim more than one clean economy ITC for 
the same project, if the project includes different types of 
eligible property. 
You can claim the credit in the tax year you incurred the 
expenses in, regardless of when the property becomes 
available for use. 
Eligible equipment is eligible for capital cost 
allowance (CCA) on a declining-balance basis in two new 
classes: 
■ class 57 with an 8% CCA rate for capture, transportation, 
and storage equipment 
■ class 58 with a 20% CCA rate for use equipment 
(equipment required for using CO2 in industrial 
production)



=== 第 136 页 ===

canada.ca/taxes 
136 
You must use the equipment as part of an eligible project. 
These classes are eligible for enhanced first year 
depreciation under the accelerated investment incentive. 
There are two new CCA classes, 59 and 60, for certain 
exploration expenses and development expenses related to 
the storage of captured carbon. 
Corporations must track and account for the capture and 
actual usage of CO2. As well, they may have to repay credit 
amounts they were previously paid if the ineligible uses are 
more than the quantities originally planned and in certain 
other circumstances. 
To claim the credit, complete Schedule 78, Carbon Capture, 
Utilization, and Storage Investment Tax Credit, and file it by 
the filing due date for the tax year you are entitled to claim 
the credit for. The CRA may accept the late filing of the 
required information, if filed by the later of 
December 31, 2025, and one year after the filing due date 
for the tax year you are entitled to claim the credit for.

Clean technology ITC 
A new refundable clean technology investment tax credit 
has been introduced. The credit is equal to 30% of the 
capital cost of eligible clean technology property that is 
acquired and that becomes available for use after 
March 27, 2023, and before 2034. The rate will be reduced 
to 15% in 2034 and nil after 2034. 
Effective November 28, 2023, businesses must elect to meet 
certain labour requirements – prevailing wage 
requirements and apprenticeship requirements. Otherwise, 
the credit rate will be reduced by 10 percentage points. 
Exemptions apply for the clean technology ITC for 
acquisitions of off-road zero-emission vehicles and 
acquisitions and installations of low-carbon heat 
equipment. 
Under proposed changes, effective November 28, 2023, it 
was clarified that the exemptions would apply to the 
preparation or installation of clean technology property 
described in Schedule II of the Regulations: 
■ in subparagraph (d)(i) of CCA class 43.1 – certain active 
solar heating equipment and ground source heat pump 
system equipment 
■ in class 56 – zero-emission self-propelled equipment that 
is not a motor vehicle, including certain additions and 
alterations 
Clean technology property includes: 
■ certain zero-emission power generation technologies 
(including concentrated solar energy equipment and 
small modular nuclear reactors) 
■ storage equipment for zero-emission energy and non-
road zero-emission vehicles 
■ geothermal energy systems, unless they are used for 
geothermal energy projects that will co-produce oil, gas, 
or other fossil fuels 
Under proposed changes, for businesses investing in 
eligible property that is acquired and becomes available for 
use on or after November 21, 2023, eligibility for the credit 
would include systems that produce electricity, heat, or 
both electricity and heat, from eligible waste biomass. 
Businesses can fully benefit from both this credit and the 
Atlantic investment tax credit. However, generally they 
cannot claim the clean technology tax credit if they claim 
one of the following credits for the same property: 
■ CCUS ITC 
■ clean hydrogen ITC 
■ clean technology manufacturing ITC 
■ clean electricity ITC 
Businesses may claim more than one clean economy ITC for 
the same project, if the project includes different types of 
eligible property. 
To claim the credit, complete Schedule 75, Clean Technology 
Investment Tax Credit, and file it with your return for the tax 
year you are entitled to claim the credit for. You must file 
the required information no later than one year after your 
filing due date for the tax year you are entitled to claim the 
credit for. 
On line 155 of Schedule 31, enter the amount of the credit 
you are claiming. 
Clean hydrogen ITC 
A new refundable tax credit, the clean hydrogen 
investment tax credit, has been introduced to support 
investments in clean hydrogen production. The credit is 
equal to between 15% and 40% of the cost of purchasing 
and installing eligible property used in the eligible project. 
This percentage depends on the carbon intensity (CI) of the 
hydrogen the project will produce. 
Processes with the lowest carbon intensity (measured as 
kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per 
kilogram of hydrogen produced) will earn the highest rate. 
The credit will not apply when the carbon intensity is 4.0 kg 
or more. 
The credit applies to property that is acquired and becomes 
available for use after March 27, 2023, and before 2035. It 
will be reduced by half for property that becomes available 
for use in 2034.

For clean ammonia equipment or certain other equipment 
used solely in connection with clean ammonia equipment, 
the rate is: 
■ 15% if the equipment becomes available for use before 
2034 
■ 7.5% if it becomes available for use in 2034 
■ 0% if it becomes available for use after 2034 
These rates apply regardless of the carbon intensity, 
provided the carbon intensity is less than 4 kg. 
At the end of a compliance period of a qualified clean 
hydrogen project, if the average actual carbon intensity is 
higher than the most recent expected carbon intensity that 
was used to determine the clean hydrogen ITC, you will be 
subject to recovery tax in the tax year in which the 
compliance period ends. 
Effective November 28, 2023, businesses must elect to meet 
certain labour requirements – prevailing wage 
requirements and apprenticeship requirements. Otherwise, 
the credit rate would be reduced by 10 percentage points. 
Under proposed changes, effective for property that is 
acquired and becomes available for use in an eligible 
project on or after December 16, 2024, the clean hydrogen 
ITC would be expanded to include projects that produce 
hydrogen from methane pyrolysis. 
Eligible equipment would include property that is used to 
produce all or substantially all hydrogen from methane 
pyrolysis (determined without reference to any solid 
carbon that is produced), such as: 
■ pyrolysis reactors 
■ heat exchangers 
■ separation equipment and purifiers 
■ compression and on-site storage equipment 
Support for the capital costs of the pyrolysis reactor system 
would be limited to $3,000 per tonne of annual hydrogen 
production capacity. 
As is the case for the clean hydrogen ITC in general, eligible 
equipment would also include dual-use electricity and heat 
equipment, project support equipment, ammonia 
production equipment, and oxygen production equipment, 
provided they satisfy the existing requirements. 
Businesses can fully benefit from both this credit and the 
Atlantic investment tax credit. However, generally they 
cannot claim the clean hydrogen tax credit if they claim one 
of the following credits for the same property: 
■ CCUS ITC 
■ clean technology ITC 
■ clean technology manufacturing ITC 
■ clean electricity ITC 
Businesses may claim more than one clean economy ITC for 
the same project, if the project includes different types of 
eligible property. 
To claim the credit, when available, complete Schedule 74, 
Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit, and file it with your 
return for the tax year you are entitled to claim the credit 
for. You must file the required information by the later of 
December 31, 2025, and the day that is one year after your 
filing due date for the tax year you are entitled to claim the 
credit for. For information on how to claim the credit before 
Schedule 74 is available, see canada.ca/en

Clean technology manufacturing ITC 
A new refundable investment tax credit has been 
introduced for: 
■ clean technology manufacturing and processing 
■ critical mineral extraction and processing 
The clean technology manufacturing investment tax credit 
is equal to 30% of the capital cost of eligible property 
associated with eligible activities. 
Eligible property generally includes machinery and 
equipment, including certain industrial vehicles, used in 
manufacturing, processing, or critical mineral extraction, as 
well as related control systems. 
The credit is not available for property used in the 
production of battery cells or modules if such production 
benefits from direct support through a special contribution 
agreement with the Government of Canada. 
Because producing qualifying materials may occur at 
polymetallic projects (projects engaged in the production of 
multiple metals), under proposed changes, several 
adjustments would be made to the credit. One of these 
includes changing to a "primarily" test for property used in 
qualifying mineral activities expected to produce qualifying 
materials at mine or well sites. 
Eligible expenditures would include investments in eligible 
property used in qualifying mineral activities that are 
expected to produce primarily (more than 50%—rather 
than 90%) qualifying materials at mine or well sites, 
including tailing ponds and mills located at these sites. 
The credit applies to property that is acquired and becomes 
available for use after 2023. It will be gradually phased out 
starting with property that becomes available for use in 
2032 as follows: 
■ 30% in 2024 to 2031 
■ 20% in 2032 
■ 10% in 2033 
■ 5% in 2034 
The credit will no longer be in effect for property that 
becomes available for use after 2034. 
Note 
The labour requirements do not apply to the clean 
technology manufacturing ITC. 
Businesses can fully benefit from both this credit and the 
Atlantic investment tax credit. However, generally they 
cannot claim the clean technology manufacturing tax credit

Clean electricity ITC (proposed) 
A new 15% refundable tax credit, the clean electricity 
investment tax credit, has been proposed to support eligible 
entities that make eligible investments to accelerate the 
supply and transmission of clean electricity. 
The credit would be available for eligible property that is 
acquired and becomes available for use after April 15, 2024, 
and before 2035, for projects that did not begin construction 
before March 28, 2023. 
Eligibility for the credit would be expanded to include 
systems that produce electricity, or both electricity and 
heat, from eligible waste biomass. 
Businesses would have to meet certain labour 
requirements – prevailing wage requirements and 
apprenticeship requirements. Otherwise, the credit rate 
would be reduced by 10 percentage points. 
Businesses could fully benefit from both this credit and the 
Atlantic investment tax credit. However, generally they 
could not claim the clean electricity tax credit if they 
claimed one of the following credits for the same property: 
■ CCUS ITC 
■ clean technology ITC 
■ clean hydrogen ITC 
■ clean technology manufacturing ITC 
Businesses could claim more than one clean economy ITC 
for the same project, if the project includes different types 
of eligible property. 
To claim the credit, when available, complete Schedule 77, 
Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, and file it with your 
return no later than one year after your filing due date for 
the tax year you would be entitled to claim the credit for. 
On line 185, when available, of Schedule 31, enter the 
amount of the credit you would be claiming. 
Electric vehicle supply chain ITC (proposed) 
The Government announced a new 10% electric vehicle 
(EV) supply chain investment tax credit. This credit would 
apply on the cost of buildings and any component part 
included in CCA class 1(q) used in key segments of 
the EV supply chain for businesses that invest in Canada 
across three supply chain segments: 
■ electric vehicle assembly 
■ electric vehicle battery production 
■ cathode active material production 
A corporation would have to invest at least $100 million in 
each of the three segments. The corporation (either by itself 
or as part of a related group, such as with a parent 
company) would have to either: 
■ acquire at least $100 million in property eligible for the 
clean technology manufacturing ITC that has become 
available for use in each of the three segments 
■ acquire at least $100 million in property eligible for the 
clean technology manufacturing ITC that has become 
available for use in each of two segments; and hold a 
qualifying minority interest in another corporation that 
acquires at least $100 million in property eligible for the 
clean technology manufacturing ITC that has become 
available for use in the remaining segment 
The credit would apply to property that is acquired and 
becomes available for use after 2023. It would be reduced to 
5% for property that becomes available for use in 2033 or 
2034, and would be zero after 2034.

This new rule would not apply to mutual fund corporations 
incorporated within the two previous years and where 
specified persons hold shares with a value of $5 million or 
less. 
The corporate group could consist of any combination of 
corporations, individuals, trusts, and partnerships that do 
not deal with each other at arm’s length. Exceptions would 
apply to make sure the measure does not adversely affect 
mutual fund corporations that are widely held pooled 
investment vehicles. 
Investment corporations and mutual fund corporations 
have to file Schedule 18, Federal and Provincial or Territorial 
Capital Gains Refund, with their returns. Schedule 18 has to 
contain the following information: 
■ details about the refundable capital gains tax on hand 
■ details of the capital gains redemption for the year 
■ a calculation of the federal capital gains refund for the 
year 
Use 28% as the percentage to determine the refundable 
capital gains tax on hand. 
The federal capital gains refund for the year is whichever is 
less: 
■ 14% of the total of: 
– the capital gains dividends paid in the period starting 
60 days after the beginning of the year and ending 
60 days after the end of the year and 
– the capital gains redemption for the year, or 
■ the refundable capital gains tax on hand at the end of the 
year 
Complete the appropriate lines on Schedule 18, and enter 
on line 788 of the return the federal capital gains refund. 
See Line 808 on page 141 for details on the provincial or 
territorial capital gains refund. 
Note 
If a corporation is established and maintained mainly to 
benefit non-residents, it does not qualify as a mutual 
fund corporation, and it cannot claim the capital gains 
refund.

or video production. 
The credit is equal to 25% of qualified labour expenditures

Line 798 – Canadian journalism labour tax 
credit 
The Canadian journalism labour tax credit is a refundable 
tax credit available to qualifying journalism 
organizations (QJO). 
The amount of the credit is set at 25% of qualifying labour 
expenditures for a tax year, for an eligible newsroom 
employee. The maximum credit available is $13,750 for 
each eligible newsroom employee per year. The credit 
amount is reduced by the amount received from the Aid to 
Publishers component of the Canada Periodical Fund. 
Note 
As a temporary measure for four years, the cap on 
labour expenditures per eligible newsroom employee is 
increased from $55,000 to $85,000. As well, the tax credit 
rate is increased from 25% to 35%. These changes apply 
to qualifying labour expenditures incurred after 2022. 
The rate will return to 25% for expenditures incurred 
after 2026. Transitional rules apply to prorate these 
changes if an organization’s tax year does not follow a 
calendar year. 
To be a QJO, as defined in subsection 125.6(1), the 
organization must be a qualified Canadian journalism 
organization (QCJO), as defined in subsection 248(1), and 
must also meet both of the following additional criteria: 
■ it does not hold a licence, as defined in subsection 2(1) of 
the Broadcasting Act 
■ if it is a corporation having share capital, it meets the 
conditions in subparagraph (e)(iii) of the definition of 
Canadian newspaper in subsection 19(5) 
To be a QCJO, an organization must apply for and be 
designated as a QCJO by the minister of National Revenue. 
An organization is deemed to have become designated as a 
QCJO on the date that it applies for designation with the 
CRA, unless otherwise specified by the minister. The CRA 
can revoke a QCJO’s designation when it no longer meets 
the eligibility requirements, but the CRA must consider any 
advice provided by an advisory board before revoking an 
organization’s designation. 
A credit can be claimed by a member (other than a 
partnership member and a specified member) of a QJO that 
is a partnership, based on the relative specified proportions, 
as defined in subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act, of 
each qualifying member for the relevant fiscal period. The 
credit allocated by the partnership to the partner is taxable 
to the partner and the partner must include it in their 
business income in the same tax year. 
For details on how to apply for designation as a QCJO, go 
to canada.ca/support-canadian-journalism and select 
“Qualified Canadian journalism organization”. 
A QCJO can go to canada.ca/support-canadian-journalism 
and select “Canadian journalism labour tax credit” for more 
information on eligibility for claiming the refundable tax 
credit and for details on calculating the credit. 
To claim the credit, file a completed Schedule 58, Canadian 
Journalism Labour Tax Credit, with your return for the year. 
On line 798 of the return, enter the amount of the credit you 
are claiming.

■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if

account for the tax year being assessed when it processes 
the return. 
For information on how to make payments, go 
to canada.ca/payments or see Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation 
Instalment Guide. For more information on calculating

Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation Instalment Guide. 
Note 
Even if you elected to report in a functional currency, 
you still have to complete line 840 in Canadian currency. 
Refund or payment 
Your refund or balance owing is the difference you get after 
subtracting all the credits on lines 780 to 840 from the total 
tax payable on line 770. 
If your total tax payable (line 770) is less than your total 
credits (line 890), enter the difference on the refund line. 
If your total payable (line 770) is more than your total 
credits (line 890), enter the difference on the balance owing 
line. 
Note 
After the CRA processes your return and applies any 
interest and/or penalty charges, if the total amount 
owing at that time is $2 or less, you will not have to pay 
that amount. If an amount of $2 or less is owed to you, 
the amount will not be refunded; however, the CRA will 
apply it to any existing liability you may have. 
Line 894 – Refund code 
If entitled to a refund, enter one of the following codes on 
line 894: 
■ enter “1” or leave this line blank if you want the CRA to 
send you the refund 
■ enter “2” if you want the CRA to transfer the refund to 
next year’s instalment account 
■ enter “3” if you want the CRA to apply the refund to 
another liability (such as an expected debit from a 
reassessment) or to a different account. Attach a letter to 
your return giving instructions and the CRA will review 
your request 
The CRA will apply the refund to any outstanding 
liabilities the corporation owes on the same or related 
business number account. Then, it will refund or transfer 
the excess overpayment according to the code you enter. 
The CRA will do this only if all the required returns have 
been filed on the account and all related accounts. 
Note 
Under subsection 220(6) of the Income Tax Act a 
corporation may assign any amount payable under this 
Act. However, according to subsection 220(7) the 
minister of National Revenue “is not required to pay to 
the assignee, the assigned amount.” As an alternative, 
the CRA will review a request to send the refund to a 
“care of” address. However, a refund issued in this 
manner will still be issued in the name of the corporation 
(see the third bullet above). 
The payment of refunds and rebates will be withheld until 
all required returns, of which the minister of National 
Revenue has knowledge, have been filed.

QR code or a self-generated QR code. For more 
information, go to canada.ca 
/payments 
■ in person at your financial institution in Canada. To do 
so, you have to use a remittance voucher which you can

by using the “View and pay account balance” service and 
selecting the “Calculate future balance” option through: 
■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business 
-account, if you are the business owner 
■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if 
you are an authorized representative or employee 
You can ask that the CRA stop issuing remittance vouchers 
and the envelope that is sent with notices and statements 
by using the “Enquiries service” and selecting the “Change 
mailing instructions” option through My Business Account 
at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account or through

Direct deposit request 
You can start, update, or stop direct deposit online, and 
also view direct deposit transactions through: 
■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business

your CRA direct deposit information will be updated the 
next day. Visit your financial institution’s website for 
information on how to sign up. 
For more information, go to canada.ca/cra-direct-deposit. 
Your direct deposit request will stay in effect until you 
change the information or cancel the service. However, if 
your financial institution advises the CRA that you have a 
new account, the CRA may deposit your payments into the 
new account. If, for any reason, it cannot deposit a payment 
into a designated account, the CRA will mail a cheque to 
you at the address on file at the time of the original 
payment. 
Note 
The CRA must generate all large-value refunds 
($25 million or more) through Lynx, Canada’s 
high-value payment system. To avoid potential delays, 
you have to be registered for direct deposit and be 
registered on the Lynx system. If you are expecting a 
large-value refund, arrange for direct deposit and 
contact your tax centre to make the necessary 
arrangements.
