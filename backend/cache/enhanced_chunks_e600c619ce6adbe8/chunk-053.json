This calculation is essential for determining the refundable portion of Part I tax for corporations.\n\n### Calculation Method\nTo calculate foreign investment income:\n\n#### Add:\n- The eligible portion of taxable capital gains for the year that exceeds the eligible portion of allowable capital losses\n- Total income from property from a source outside Canada, after deducting:\n  - Exempt income\n  - Taxable dividends deductible after deducting related expenses\n  - Business income from an interest in a trust that is considered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a)\n\n#### Deduct:\n- Total losses for the year from property from a source outside Canada\n\n### Reporting Requirements\nEnter the calculated foreign investment income on line 445 of your return. This amount should match the value determined on line 079 of Schedule 7.\n\nFor tax years starting after 2018, enter the amount from line 450 at amount H in the \"Refundable dividend tax on hand\" area on page 7 of your return.\n\n**Example:** A Canadian corporation received $10,000 in foreign interest income and $5,000 in eligible foreign capital gains. They also incurred $2,000 in foreign capital losses. The foreign investment income would be $10,000 + ($5,000 - $2,000) = $13,000.\n\n## Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand (RDTOH)\n\n### Overview\nThe dividend refund mechanism for private corporations is based on two separate accounts:\n- Eligible Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand (ERDTOH)\n- Non-eligible Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand (NERDTOH)\n\n### Eligibility and Application\nERDTOH and NERDTOH accounts apply only to corporations that were private or subject corporations during the tax year.\n\n**Key distinctions:**\n- CCPCs and substantive CCPCs generate NERDTOH on the refundable portion of Part I tax paid on investment income\n- All private corporations generate both ERDTOH and NERDTOH on Part IV tax paid on dividends received\n- Only Part IV tax generates ERDTOH and NERDTOH for non-CCPC private corporations\n\n### ERDTOH Calculation\nTo calculate ERDTOH at year-end, add:\n1. Previous year's ERDTOH balance (line 520 minus amount G)\n2. Any ERDTOH balance transferred from:\n   - A predecessor corporation on amalgamation\n   - A wound-up subsidiary corporation (line 525)\n3. Part IV taxes payable (amount Q) on:\n   - Eligible dividends received from non-connected corporations\n   - Taxable dividends received from connected corporations that caused a dividend refund to the payer corporation from its ERDTOH\n\n### NERDTOH Calculation\nTo calculate NERDTOH at year-end, add:\n1. Previous year's NERDTOH balance (line 535 minus line 575)\n2. The refundable portion of Part I tax (line 450)\n3. Any NERDTOH balance transferred from:\n   - A predecessor corporation on amalgamation\n   - A wound-up subsidiary corporation (line 540)\n4. Part IV tax payable (excluding amounts allocated to ERDTOH) (amount P)\n\n### Special Considerations\nA predecessor corporation or subsidiary cannot transfer ERDTOH or NERDTOH to a new or parent corporation through amalgamation or wind-up if subsection 129(1.2) would have applied to a dividend paid just before the transaction.\n\n### Reporting Requirements\n- Enter ERDTOH on line 530 and at amount BB in the \"Dividend refund\" area\n- Enter NERDTOH on line 545 and at amount EE in the same area\n\n**Example:** A CCPC had a previous year's NERDTOH balance of $5,000, paid $3,000 in refundable Part I tax on investment income, and received $2,000 in Part IV tax on non-eligible dividends. The NERDTOH at year-end would be $5,000 + $3,000 + $2,000 = $10,000.\n\n## Dividend Refund\n\n### Eligibility Requirements\nA dividend refund may be available if:\n1. The corporation pays taxable dividends to shareholders\n2. There is an ERDTOH or NERDTOH balance at year-end\n\n### Types of Dividends Eligible for Refund\n- Stock dividends\n- Section 84 deemed dividends\n- Amounts paid as interest or dividends on income bonds or debentures that are not deductible when calculating income\n\n### Refund Calculation Method\n\n#### For Eligible Dividends:\nThe refund equals the lesser of:\n- 38 1/3% of total eligible dividends paid during the year\n- ERDTOH account balance at year-end\n\n#### For Non-eligible Dividends:\nThe refund consists of two components:\n1. The lesser of:\n   - 38 1/3% of total non-eligible dividends paid during the year\n   - NERDTOH account balance at year-end\n2. The lesser of:\n   - The excess of 38 1/3% of non-eligible dividends over NERDTOH balance\n   - The excess of ERDTOH balance over the amount calculated for eligible dividends (amount 1)\n\n**Example:** A corporation paid $30,000 in eligible dividends and $20,000 in non-eligible dividends. With an ERDTOH balance of $15,000 and NERDTOH balance of $8,000:\n- Eligible dividend refund: lesser of $11,250 (38 1/3% of $30,000) and $15,000 = $11,250\n- Non-eligible dividend refund: lesser of $7,667 (38 1/3% of $20,000) and $8,000 = $7,667\n- Total refund: $11,250 + $7,667 = $18,917\n\n### Time Limitations\nTo claim a dividend refund, you must file your income tax return within three years of the tax year-end. If filed after this period, the dividend refund becomes statute-barred.\n\n### Schedule 3 Completion\nComplete parts 3 and 4 of Schedule 3 to claim a dividend refund. The total of taxable dividends paid that qualify for a dividend refund should be entered on line 460 of Schedule 3.\n\n### Special Circumstances\nA private or subject corporation may claim a dividend refund for dividends paid while it had that status, even if it changed status during the year. If a corporation loses private status following a change in control, a deemed year-end occurs, and the corporation may claim a dividend refund for dividends paid during the short year.",
