## Schedule 6, Capital Gains and Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)

### Transactions in Foreign Currency

Transactions in foreign currency or foreign currency futures that do not form part of the business operations can be considered capital dispositions.

**References:**
- Subsection 39(2)
- IT-95, Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses

For dispositions of depreciable property, a capital gain results if the proceeds are more than the capital cost. However, losses on depreciable property do not result in capital losses. These losses are terminal losses. See "Column 10 – UCC" (undepreciated capital cost) on page 51 to find out more about terminal losses.

Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on disposition of other properties at amount D.

### Part 5 – Personal-use Property

In this part, describe any personal-use property you disposed of during the tax year.

Personal-use property of a corporation is property owned mainly for the personal use or enjoyment of an individual who is related to the corporation.

Use the $1,000 rule to determine gains and losses when you dispose of personal-use property. According to this rule, if the adjusted cost base is less than $1,000, it is considered to be $1,000. As well, when the proceeds of disposition are less than $1,000, they are considered to be $1,000.

**Example:** If a corporation disposes of personal-use property with an adjusted cost base of $600 and proceeds of $800, both amounts are deemed to be $1,000, resulting in no capital gain.

The $1,000 rule will not apply when donors acquire personal-use property as part of an arrangement in which the property is gifted to a qualified donee, such as a registered charity.

You cannot deduct losses on dispositions of personal-use property (other than listed personal property or a debt that is personal-use property) from your income.

Enter the total amount of gain realized on disposition of personal-use property at amount E.

**Reference:**
- Subsection 46(1)

### Part 6 – Listed Personal Property

In this part, describe any listed personal property disposed of during the tax year.

Listed personal property is a special category of personal-use property that usually increases in value. The following is a complete list of the different types of listed personal property:
- Prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other similar works of art
- Jewellery
- Rare folios, rare manuscripts, or rare books
- Stamps
- Coins

If you incur losses from disposing of listed personal property, you can only deduct these losses from capital gains realized from disposing of listed personal property.

On line 655, enter the amount of listed personal property losses from previous years you want to apply against current-year net listed personal property gains. Also, enter this amount on line 530 of Schedule 4, Corporation Loss Continuity and Application.

You can apply any unabsorbed losses in the current year to reduce similar net gains realized in the three preceding years, and in the following seven years. See "Part 5 – Listed personal property losses" on page 68 for more details.

At amount F, enter the total amount of gains or losses realized on disposition of listed personal property minus the amount of line 655.

### Part 7 – Property Qualifying for and Resulting in an Allowable Business Investment Loss

Generally, a business investment loss arises from the arm's length disposition (or deemed disposition) of:
- Shares of a small business corporation
- Certain debts owed to the corporation by a small business corporation, certain bankrupt corporations, or certain wound-up corporations (these corporations have to deal with the corporation at arm's length)

A small business corporation is defined in subsection 248(1).

Complete Part 7 to calculate the business investment losses at amount G.

### Capital Gains Reserve

Often, you will not receive part of the proceeds of disposition, usually for real property, until after the end of the year. In these cases, you can defer part of the capital gain to the year the corporation is due to receive the proceeds by setting up a capital gains reserve. By using reserves, you can spread a capital gain over a maximum of five years.

**Example:** If a corporation sells property for $500,000 with $400,000 received in the current year and $100,000 due in 2 years, it can claim a reserve for the portion not yet received.

Generally, a corporation that has made a gift of a non-qualifying security to a qualified donee may claim a reserve for any gain realized on this security. The reserve claimed by the corporation cannot exceed the eligible amount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift is the amount by which the fair market value of the property that is the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of the advantage, if any, in respect of the gift.

A reserve can only be claimed if the donation is not deducted for tax purposes and the donee does not dispose of the security or the security does not cease to be a non-qualifying security. This reserve can only be claimed in tax years ending within 60 months of making the gift.

The reserve must be included in income if the corporation becomes a non-resident or tax exempt.

The reserve that you can claim in a tax year cannot be more than the lesser of the following two amounts:

**A.** Capital gain × Amount not due until after the end of the year / Proceeds of disposition

**B.**
- For the year of disposition: 4/5 of the capital gain
- For the second year: 3/5 of the capital gain
- For the third year: 2/5 of the capital gain
- For the fourth year: 1/5 of the capital gain

Add the reserve amount you deducted in a tax year to income in the following tax year.

Add the reserve opening balance and subtract the reserve closing balance on lines 880 and 885 of Schedule 6.

Show the continuity of capital gain reserves on Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves. See page 64 for details.

**References:**
- Subparagraphs 40(1)(a)(ii) and 40(1)(a)(iii)
- Subsection 40(1.01)

### Part 8 – Capital Gains or Losses

When completing this part, line 875 is the capital gains dividends. Capital gains dividends under paragraphs 130.1(4)(a) and (b) and 131(1)(a) and (b) are considered to be capital gains. These paragraphs apply to mortgage investment corporations and mutual fund corporations. If you received any capital gains dividends in the tax year, enter them on this line.

Line 880 is the balance at the beginning of the year of the capital gains reserve from Schedule 13. This amount should include any amount from the last tax year of predecessor corporations after amalgamation or wind-up.

### Part 9 – Taxable Capital Gains and Total Capital Losses

Generally, a zero inclusion rate applies for capital gains arising as a result of a gift to qualified donees of certain securities or of environmentally sensitive land. The zero inclusion rate is restricted to only part of the capital gain if the taxpayer is entitled to an advantage or benefit in respect of a gift.

When completing this part, line 895 is the full amount of capital gains realized on donations of a security listed on a designated stock exchange, a share or unit of a mutual fund, an interest in a segregated fund, or a prescribed debt obligation made to a qualified donee.

Generally, if you donate property to a qualified donee that is included in a flow-through share class of property, and you have an exemption threshold for the flow-through share class of property, you may be deemed to have an additional capital gain from the disposition of another capital property subject to the 50% inclusion rate.

Amounts under section 34.2 (the adjusted stub period accrual regime) that have the character of capital are to be entered in this part of Schedule 6 and not on line 130 of Schedule 1.

Since these amounts are deemed to be taxable capital gains/allowable capital losses under the rules in section 34.2 and so already reflect the 50% inclusion rate, they are multiplied by 2 on Schedule 6 to calculate the total capital gains or losses of the corporation.

In general, if you dispose of an interest in a partnership to tax-exempt entities, non-resident persons, or partnerships and trusts that have such members or beneficiaries, a special rule may apply.

Under subsection 100(1), part of the capital gain may be subject to the 50% inclusion rate and another part may be subject to a 100% inclusion rate.

The portion of the capital gain that can reasonably be attributed to increases in the value of capital property (other than depreciable property) held directly by the partnership (or held indirectly by the partnership through one or more other partnerships) is subject to the 50% inclusion rate and the rest is subject to the 100% inclusion rate.

If all the partnership assets are inventory, depreciable property, or resource property, then the capital gain would be subject to the 100% inclusion rate unless an exception applies. If there is also capital property (other than depreciable property), then it's an apportionment.

If subsection 100(1) applies, enter the result of the portion of the capital gain that is subject to the 100% inclusion rate multiplied by 2 on line 902. Enter the portion of the capital gain that is subject to the 50% inclusion rate in Part 4.

Amount P is the capital gain or loss for the year. If the amount is a loss, enter it at amount Q of Schedule 6 and line 210 of Schedule 4. If the amount is a gain, enter the result of amount P multiplied by 1/2 at amount R of Schedule 6 and line 113 of Schedule 1.

- Paragraphs 38(a.1) and 38(a.2)

### Allowable Business Investment Loss (ABIL)

You can deduct an ABIL from all sources of income for the year. If any balance remains after the year the loss occurs, it becomes part of the non-capital loss. You can carry the non-capital loss back 3 tax years and carry it forward 10 tax years.

If you are unable to deduct an ABIL as a non-capital loss within this allowed time frame, the unused part becomes a net capital loss, and you can carry it forward indefinitely to reduce taxable capital gains.

Include all unused ABIL after the applicable carry-forward period in Part 2, "Capital losses", of Schedule 4. See page 67, for more details.

- Paragraph 39(1)(c)
- S4-F8-C1, Business Investment Losses

## Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)

Paragraph 20(1)(a) allows a corporation to deduct part of the capital cost of certain depreciable property from income it earned in the year from a business or property. This deduction is called capital cost allowance.

Complete Schedule 8 to calculate CCA.

When a tax year is shorter than 12 months, you generally have to prorate the CCA.

Under Part XI of the Income Tax Regulations, depreciable property is grouped into prescribed classes. Schedule II of the Regulations contains a complete list of these prescribed classes.

A maximum rate is prescribed for each class. Apply the prescribed rate to the undepreciated capital cost of the class at year-end to determine the maximum CCA you can claim. You can deduct any amount up to the maximum that is available for the year.

### Disability-related Modifications

You can deduct outlays and expenses you incur for eligible disability-related modifications made to a building in the year you paid them, instead of having to add them to the capital cost of your building. Eligible disability-related modifications include changes you make to accommodate wheelchairs. You can also deduct expenses paid to install or get disability-related devices and equipment.

You can claim this as "Other deductions" on Schedule 1, Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes.

### Available-for-use Rule

The available-for-use rule determines the earliest tax year in which you can claim CCA for depreciable property.

#### When is property available for use?

Property other than a building is considered available for use at the earliest of several dates. The following are some examples of these dates:
- When the corporation first uses the property to earn income
- The beginning of the first tax year that starts at least 358 days after the tax year during which the corporation acquired the property
- Immediately before the corporation disposes of the property
- When the corporation can use the property to either produce a saleable product or perform a saleable service

A building is considered available for use on the earliest of the following dates:
- When the corporation uses all or substantially all of the building for its intended purpose
- When construction of the building is completed
- The beginning of the first tax year that starts at least 358 days after the tax year during which the corporation acquired the property
- Immediately before the corporation disposes of the property
- When the corporation acquires a replacement property, if it is replacing one it involuntarily disposed of (for example, expropriation) that it either acquired before 1990 or had already become available for use

**Note:** If a corporation acquires a property for a long-term project, it can elect to limit the impact of the available-for-use rule. This election is not available for rental buildings. To make this election, send the CRA a completed Form T1031, Subsection 13(29) Election in Respect of Certain Depreciable Properties, Acquired for use in a Long Term Project, with your return.

**References:**
- Subsections 13(26) to 13(32)
- Election under Regulation 1101(5q)

### Line 101 – Is the corporation electing under Regulation 1101(5q)?

Tick the yes or no box.

This election allows you to include certain property usually included in classes 8 and 43 in a separate class. You have to have acquired each property at a capital cost of at least $1,000. The types of properties that qualify for this election include manufacturing and processing property, photocopiers, and electronic communications equipment, such as facsimile transmission devices or telephone equipment.

You can elect to classify a property in a separate class or several properties in one or more than one separate class.

This election can allow you to claim a terminal loss, which is any remaining undepreciated capital cost at the time of disposition of the properties in this class. For more information on terminal losses, see "Column 10 – UCC" (undepreciated capital cost).

## CCA Rates and Classes

### Purpose-built Rental Housing – Class 1

Under proposed changes, an accelerated CCA rate of 10% under class 1 would be available for new eligible purpose-built rental housing projects that:
- Begin construction after April 15, 2024, and before 2031, and
- Are available for use before 2036

Investments eligible for this measure would continue to benefit from the accelerated investment incentive (AII). The AII currently suspends the half-year rule, providing a CCA deduction at the full rate for eligible property that becomes available for use before 2028.

Eligible property would be new purpose-built rental housing that is a residential complex:
- With at least 4 private apartment units (a unit with a private kitchen, bathroom, and living areas) or 10 private rooms or suites, and
- In which at least 90% of residential units are held for long-term rental

If the above conditions are met, the new rate would also be available to:
- Projects that convert existing non-residential real estate, such as an office building, into a residential complex
- New additions to an existing residential complex

The accelerated CCA would not apply to renovations of existing residential complexes.

### Productivity-enhancing Assets – Classes 44, 46, and 50

Under proposed changes, for new additions of property to CCA classes 44, 46, and 50, immediate expensing (a 100% first-year deduction) would be provided if the property is acquired after April 15, 2024, and becomes available for use before 2027. Property that becomes available for use in 2027 would continue to benefit from the AII.

### Zero-emission Vehicles – Classes 54 and 55

Two CCA classes (54 and 55) were added for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) acquired after March 18, 2019.

Class 55 was created for zero-emission vehicles otherwise included in class 16, essentially automobiles for lease or rent and taxicabs, with the same CCA rate of 40%. Class 54 was created for zero-emission vehicles that would otherwise be included in class 10 or 10.1, essentially other automobiles, with the same CCA rate of 30%. The CCA still applies on a declining-balance basis.

A corporation may elect to not include in class 54 or 55 a vehicle that would otherwise be a zero-emission vehicle. When such an election is filed, the vehicle will no longer be considered to be a zero-emission vehicle. As a result, the vehicle will be included in its usual CCA class 10, 10.1 or 16. A corporation has to file this election with the minister of National Revenue in its return of income for the tax year in which the vehicle is acquired.

An eligible zero-emission vehicle is essentially a motor vehicle for use on streets and highways (excluding a trolley bus or vehicle operated only on rails). It must be fully electric, or a plug-in hybrid that has a battery capacity of at least 7 kWh, or fully powered by hydrogen. It must not have been used, or acquired for use, for any purpose before it was acquired by the corporation, unless the corporation acquires it after March 1, 2020.

It cannot be a vehicle:
- For which the Government of Canada paid assistance under a prescribed program such as the federal purchase incentive announced in the 2019 federal budget (presently there is only one prescribed program)
- That the corporation elected not to include in class 54 or 55
- For which an amount has been deducted as CCA or a terminal loss has been claimed by another person or partnership

In addition, a zero-emission vehicle has to be acquired, and become available for use, after March 18, 2019, and before 2028. An enhanced first-year CCA is available as follows:
- 100% after March 18, 2019, and before 2024
- 75% after 2023 and before 2026
- 55% after 2025 and before 2028

Under proposed changes, the immediate expensing measure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year phase out after 2029.

For the enhanced first-year allowance, the following step should be done before calculating the CCA:
- Increase the net capital cost addition to the new class for property that becomes available for use before 2028 as follows:
  - For class 54, increase the capital cost addition by an amount equal to:
    - 2 1/3 times the net addition to the class for property that becomes available for use before 2024
    - 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property that becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025
    - 5/6 times the net addition to the class for property that becomes available for use after 2025 and before 2028
  - For class 55, increase the capital cost addition by an amount equal to:
    - 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property that becomes available for use before 2024
    - 7/8 times the net addition to the class for property that becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025
    - 3/8 times the net addition to the class for property that becomes available for use after 2025 and before 2028
- Suspend the existing CCA half-year rule

Multiply the result by the prescribed CCA rate of 30% for class 54 and 40% for class 55.

The CCA will apply to any remaining balance for the new classes using the set rate for each class.

These measures do not change the total amount that can be deducted over the life of the vehicle, it just allows a larger deduction in the first year.

A zero-emission passenger vehicle is an automobile that is included in class 54. When the capital cost of a zero-emission passenger vehicle is more than a prescribed amount ($61,000 plus sales tax for vehicles acquired on or after January 1, 2023), the capital cost of the vehicle is deemed to be the prescribed amount. This amount will be reviewed annually.

If a zero-emission passenger vehicle is disposed of to a person or partnership with which the corporation deals at arm's length and its cost is more than the prescribed amount, the proceeds of disposition will be adjusted based on a factor equal to the prescribed amount as a proportion of the actual cost of the vehicle. But for dispositions made after July 29, 2019, the actual cost of the vehicle will be adjusted for payment or repayment of government assistance.

### Zero-emission Vehicles – Class 56

A temporary enhanced first-year capital cost allowance (CCA) of 100% is available for eligible zero-emission automotive equipment and vehicles (other than motor vehicles) that currently do not benefit from the accelerated rate provided by classes 54 and 55. These vehicles and equipment are included in class 56. They have to be acquired after March 1, 2020, and become available for use before 2028.

The enhanced CCA applies only for the tax year in which the equipment or vehicle first becomes available for use. It is subject to the following phase-out:
- 100% after March 1, 2020, and before 2024
- 75% after 2023 and before 2026
- 55% after 2025 and before 2028

Under proposed changes, the immediate expensing measure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year phase out after 2029.

To be eligible for the enhanced first year allowance, a vehicle or equipment must be automotive (that is, self-propelled) and fully electric or powered by hydrogen. Vehicles or equipment that are powered partially by electricity or hydrogen (which includes hybrid vehicles and vehicles that require human or animal power for propulsion) are not eligible.

Class 56 captures automotive equipment that is not designed for use on highways or streets such as zero-emission aircraft, watercraft, trolley buses and railway locomotives. Additions or alterations may qualify if they convert automotive equipment (other than a motor vehicle) into a zero-emission property.

The CCA is deductible on any remaining balance on a declining balance basis at a rate of 30%.

An election is available to not include the vehicle or equipment in class 56. As a result, the property will then be included in the class for which it would otherwise be eligible.

Class 56 excludes property for which CCA or a terminal loss has previously been claimed by another person or partnership where the equipment was acquired by the corporation on a tax-deferred "rollover" basis or it was previously owned or acquired by the corporation or a non-arm's length person or partnership.

### Accelerated Investment Incentive Property

Accelerated investment incentive property (AIIP) is a property (other than property included in classes 54 to 56) that is acquired by the corporation after November 20, 2018, and becomes available for use before 2028.

Under proposed changes, the accelerated investment incentive measure would be reinstated for qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year phase out after 2029.

The property has to meet one of the following conditions:
- No person or partnership (including the corporation) has claimed capital cost allowance (or a terminal loss) for the property
- It has not been transferred to the corporation on a tax-deferred "rollover" basis
- It was not previously owned or acquired by the corporation or a non-arm's length person or partnership

The following measures are available to AIIP:
- **Accelerated investment incentive** – Providing an enhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible property that is subject to the CCA rules. In general, the incentive is made up of two elements:
  - An increase up to 50% of the net capital cost addition to a class for property that becomes available for use before 2024
  - Suspending the existing CCA half-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and class 13 property) for property that becomes available for use before 2028.

**Note:** Under the half-year rule, in general, property other than AIIP or property included in classes 54 to 56, acquired during the tax year, is eligible for only 50% of the normal maximum CCA for the year. You can claim full CCA for that property in the next tax year. See Regulation 1100(2).

- **Full expensing for manufacturers and processors** – Allowing businesses to immediately write off the full cost of machinery and equipment used for the manufacturing or processing of goods (class 53 or property included in class 43 and acquired after 2025, if the property would have been included in class 53 if it had been acquired in 2025).

- **Full expensing for clean energy investments** – Allowing businesses to immediately write off the full cost of specified clean energy equipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). A phase-out will begin for property that becomes available for use after 2023. For the 2024 and 2025 years, corporations may immediately write off 75% of specified clean energy equipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2).

Under proposed changes, the immediate expensing measure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for qualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that becomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year phase out after 2029.

An enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible Canadian development expenses and Canadian oil and gas property expenses incurred after November 20, 2018, and before 2028. The enhanced deduction will begin to be phased out for expenses made after 2023.

The accelerated investment incentive applies to property for which CCA is calculated on a declining-balance basis (including class 14.1, intangible property), as well as property with straight-line depreciation (for example, leasehold improvement, patents, and limited period licences). A phase-out will begin for property that becomes available for use after 2023.

In certain situations, rules related to limited partners, specified leasing properties, specified energy properties and rental properties can restrict a CCA deduction, or a loss for such a deduction, that would otherwise be available. These rules continue to apply.

The accelerated investment incentive does not change the total amount that can be deducted over the life of the property, it just allows a larger deduction in the first year.

### Designated Immediate Expensing Property

Designated immediate expensing property (DIEP) is a property (other than property included in classes 1 to 6, 14.1, 17, 47, 49 and 51) that is acquired by a CCPC after April 18, 2021, becomes available for use in the tax year and before 2024, is designated as such in prescribed form filed by the CCPC within 12 months of the filing-due date for the tax year the designation relates to.
