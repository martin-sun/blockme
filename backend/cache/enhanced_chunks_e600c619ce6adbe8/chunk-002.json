  "enhanced_content": "## Developer Guide: Mapping Credits to the T2 Corporate Return Structure\n\nThis section outlines the structural components of the T2 Corporation Income Tax Return where tax credits are reported and calculated. Understanding this flow is essential for building accurate tax calculation modules.\n\n---\n\n## Page 2 of the T2 Return (T2 Corporation Income Tax Return)\n\nPage 2 of the T2 return is the primary calculation summary. It aggregates figures from all supporting schedules to determine the corporation's final tax liability.\n\n*   **Relevance to Credits:** This is where the totals for all non-refundable and refundable tax credits are ultimately applied to reduce Part I tax.\n*   **Key Lines:** Your application must post the calculated totals for various credits to the specific lines designated on this page (e.g., the total non-refundable tax credits and total refundable tax credits).\n*   **Actionable Insight:** The final output of your credit calculation engines must be formatted to populate the correct fields on the T2 return's Page 2 to compute the final `Tax Payable` or `Refundable`.\n\n---\n\n## Attachments\n\nThe \"Attachments\" section refers to all supplementary schedules and forms that provide the detailed calculations and information supporting the figures on Page 2. For developers, these represent the data sources and calculation worksheets for individual credits.\n\n### Information Schedules and Forms\n\nThese schedules are used to report the detailed data that serves as the basis for calculating a credit. They are primarily for data collection.\n\n*   **Purpose:** To capture the specific facts and figures required to determine credit eligibility and amount.\n*   **Practical Examples:**\n    *   **SR&ED Investment Tax Credit:** `Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim` is an information form. It details all eligible expenditures (e.g., salaries, materials) but does not calculate the final credit value.\n    *   **Donation and Gift Credits:** `Schedule 9, Donations and Gifts` is an information schedule. It lists all charitable donations made during the year, which are then used to calculate the federal and provincial donation tax credits.\n*   **Actionable Insight:** Design your application's input interfaces and database schemas to capture the granular data required by these information schedules. The data collected here is the primary input for your credit calculation logic.\n\n### Calculation Schedules\n\nThese schedules perform the actual computations, taking data from information schedules and other parts of the return to determine the final credit amount.\n\n*   **Purpose:** To apply the correct tax rates, limits, and rules to the information data, resulting in a final credit value.\n*   **Practical Examples:**\n    *   **Investment Tax Credits (including SR&ED):** `Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credits` is the primary calculation schedule. It takes the qualified expenditures from `Form T661` and other sources, applies the appropriate enhanced and base credit rates, and calculates the total refundable and non-refundable investment tax credits.\n    *   **General Tax Reduction & Small Business Deduction:** `Schedule 5, Tax Calculation Supplementary - Corporations` calculates the General Tax Reduction for Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations (CCPCs) and the Small Business Deduction. It uses taxable income figures and other data to compute these reductions, which function similarly to credits.\n*   **Actionable Insight:** Implement your core business logic for each credit to mirror the calculations on these schedules. The output of your calculation module for a specific credit should reconcile with the final value on its corresponding calculation schedule before being posted to Page 2 of the return.",
