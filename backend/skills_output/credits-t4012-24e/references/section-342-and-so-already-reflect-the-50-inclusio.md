## Capital Gains and Losses

### Partnership Disposition Rules

When disposing of an interest in a partnership to tax-exempt entities, non-resident persons, or partnerships/trusts with such members, special rules under subsection 100(1) may apply:

- **50% inclusion rate portion**: Attributable to increases in value of capital property (excluding depreciable property) held directly or indirectly by the partnership
- **100% inclusion rate portion**: Applies to the remaining gain

**Example**: A corporation disposes of a partnership interest for $500,000. The partnership holds:
- $300,000 in capital property (50% inclusion rate)
- $200,000 in inventory/depreciable property (100% inclusion rate)

The corporation would report:
- $150,000 capital gain (50% of $300,000) at 50% inclusion rate
- $200,000 capital gain at 100% inclusion rate

**Implementation Note**: For tax applications, track the composition of partnership assets to correctly apply inclusion rates.

### Allowable Business Investment Losses (ABIL)

ABILs can be deducted from all sources of income in the year incurred. Any remaining balance becomes a non-capital loss with the following treatment:

- **Non-capital loss carryback**: Up to 3 tax years
- **Non-capital loss carryforward**: Up to 10 tax years
- **After carryforward period expires**: Becomes a net capital loss with indefinite carryforward

**Example**: A corporation realizes a $50,000 ABIL in 2023:
- $30,000 deducted against 2023 income
- $20,000 carried back to 2021 (reducing taxes paid)
- If still unused after 2033, becomes net capital loss

**Implementation Note**: Track ABILs separately from other losses to apply correct carryforward/carryback periods.

## Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)

### Basic CCA Rules

CCA allows corporations to deduct part of the capital cost of depreciable property from income. Key principles:

- **Calculation**: Apply prescribed rates to undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at year-end
- **Short tax years**: Prorate CCA for periods less than 12 months
- **Property classes**: Grouped according to Schedule II of Income Tax Regulations

**Implementation Note**: Maintain separate UCC balances for each CCA class.

### Available-for-Use Rule

The available-for-use rule determines when CCA can first be claimed:

**Non-building property** is available for use at the earliest of:
- First use to earn income
- Beginning of tax year starting ≥358 days after acquisition year
- Immediately before disposition
- When property can produce saleable products/services

**Buildings** are available for use at the earliest of:
- When substantially all used for intended purpose
- When construction completed
- Beginning of tax year starting ≥358 days after acquisition year
- Immediately before disposition
- When replacement property acquired (for involuntary dispositions)

**Implementation Note**: Track acquisition dates and first-use dates for all depreciable assets.

### Special CCA Classes and Rates

#### Purpose-built Rental Housing (Class 1)

**Accelerated CCA rate**: 10% for new eligible projects that:
- Begin construction after April 15, 2024, and before 2031
- Are available for use before 2036

**Eligibility requirements**:
- ≥4 private apartment units OR ≥10 private rooms/suites
- ≥90% of units held for long-term rental

**Implementation Note**: Track construction start dates and availability dates to apply accelerated rate.

#### Zero-emission Vehicles (Classes 54, 55, and 56)

**Class 54**: ZEVs otherwise in class 10/10.1 (30% rate)
**Class 55**: ZEVs otherwise in class 16 (40% rate)

**Enhanced first-year CCA**:
- 100% for property available before 2024
- 75% for property available in 2024-2025
- 55% for property available in 2026-2027

**Example**: A corporation acquires a $60,000 ZEV in 2023:
- Enhanced first-year CCA: $60,000 × 100% = $60,000
- Remaining UCC: $0

**Implementation Note**: Track vehicle types, acquisition dates, and availability dates to apply correct rates.

**Eligibility**: Property acquired after November 20, 2018, available before 2028
**Benefits**:
- Enhanced first-year allowance (up to 50% increase)

**Implementation Note**: Track acquisition dates to determine AIIP eligibility.
