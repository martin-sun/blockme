### Part 7 – Limited Partnership Losses

#### Current-Year Limited Partnership Losses

Use this part to calculate the current-year limited partnership losses that cannot be deducted in the year, but can be carried forward to other years.

**Key Requirements:**
- The amount of partnership loss allocated to a limited partner is reported on an information slip T5013, Statement of Partnership Income
- If the limited partner does not receive this slip because the partnership is exempt from filing, you have to file the partnership's financial statements with the return to prove the corporation's share of the partnership loss for the year
- Report the amount in the corporation's tax year that the partnership's fiscal period ends in

**Important Notes:**
- The part of a partnership loss that a limited partner can deduct in determining net income for income tax purposes may be restricted
- For tax years that end after February 26, 2018, it was clarified that the at-risk rules apply to a partnership that is itself a limited partner of another partnership and that a corporation's available non-capital loss and limited partnership loss carry forward balances have to be adjusted as if these rules applied in the preceding years

**Line-by-Line Instructions:**

**Column 606** - Enter the corporation's at-risk amount at the fiscal period ending of the partnership (column 602). The amount entered in column 604 is from a business (other than a farming or fishing business) or from property.

**At-Risk Amount Calculation:**
In general terms, you have to calculate a limited partner's at-risk amount as follows:
- The adjusted cost base of its partnership interest
- Plus its share of the current-year's income from the partnership
- Minus all amounts the partner owes to the partnership
- Minus any amount or benefit to which the partner is entitled that is intended to protect it from the loss of its investment

**Exemption from At-Risk Rules:**
In general, interests in partnerships that were operating on a regular and continuous basis on February 25, 1986, and continuously thereafter, are exempt from the at-risk rules. However, partnership interests may lose their exempt status if, after February 25, 1986, there has been either a substantial contribution of capital to the partnership or substantial partnership borrowings.

**Column 620** - Enter the difference between the corporation's share of the actual loss of the partnership and the corporation's at-risk amount (reduced by any investment tax credit, clean economy tax credit, farming losses and resource expenses the partnership allocated to the corporation for that fiscal period). This amount is called a limited partnership loss.

**Line 222 of Schedule 1** - Add the total of column 620 to this line.

**Column 670** - Enter all those losses in this column to establish the continuity of losses.

**References:**
- Subsection 96(2.1)
- IT-232, Losses – Their Deductibility in the Loss Year or in Other Years

#### Limited Partnership Losses from Previous Tax Years That May Be Applied in the Current Year

Complete this part if you want to apply limited partnership losses from previous years to reduce any kind of income in the current year. However, the deductible amount in respect of each partnership is limited to the difference between the balance of losses for that partnership and the corporation's at-risk amount for that partnership after deducting the amounts specified under subparagraph 111(1)(e)(ii).

#### Continuity of Limited Partnership Losses That Can Be Carried Forward to Future Tax Years

Limited partnership losses can be carried forward indefinitely to future years.

**Column 664** - Enter the amount of limited partnership losses transferred from a predecessor corporation after amalgamation, or a subsidiary after wind-up, where not less than 90% of the issued shares in each class were, immediately before the wind-up, owned by the corporation. This amount is the unused limited partnership losses available to carry forward at the end of the tax year of the predecessor corporation or subsidiary ending immediately before the amalgamation or wind-up.

**Column 680** - The result of this part is the amount of limited partnership losses you carry forward to later years.

### Part 8 – Election Under Paragraph 88(1.1)(f)

Further to a winding-up of a subsidiary, the part of a non-capital loss, restricted farm loss, farm loss, or limited partnership loss incurred by the subsidiary is deemed to be the parent corporation's loss for its tax year starting after the winding-up has begun.

Paragraph 88(1.1)(f) allows the parent corporation to elect that this loss is deemed to be a loss from its tax year previous to the year mentioned above.

**Box 190** - Tick this box if you are making an election under paragraph 88(1.1)(f).

## Taxable Income

The following section explains how to calculate the deductions you may be able to claim to reduce net income. You will use these amounts to arrive at your taxable income.

### Line 300 – Net Income or (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes

On line 300, enter the net income or loss for income tax purposes, as you calculated on Schedule 1. If you did not have to make any adjustments to the net income or loss from the financial statements or the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI), enter on line 300 the net income or loss from the income statement. Show the amount of any loss in brackets.

**Important Note:**
On Schedule 1, do not deduct charitable donations, taxable dividends, net capital losses, non-capital losses, farm losses, or restricted farm losses from other years. You have to deduct these items from net income for income tax purposes to arrive at taxable income.

### Lines 311 to 314 – Charitable Donations and Gifts

**Important Deadline Update for 2024:**
The deadline for making donations eligible for tax support in the 2024 tax year is proposed to be extended until February 28, 2025.

Gifts made before March 2025 are deemed to have been made in a tax year of a corporation that ends after November 14, 2024, and before 2025 (the "donation year"), and not in the corporation's 2025 tax year, if all of the following apply:
- The gift would be deductible under section 110.1 in computing the corporation's taxable income under Part I for the year if it were made immediately before the end of the donation year
- The corporation deducts the amount of the gift under this section for the corporation's donation year
- The gift was in the form of cash or was transferred by way of cheque, credit card, money order or electronic payment

The amount deductible by the corporation will generally be the eligible amount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift is the amount by which the fair market value of the property that is the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of the advantage, if any, in respect of the gift. For more information on the tax treatment of charitable gifts and the meaning of the term gift, see Pamphlet P113, Gifts and Income Tax, and Income Tax Folio S7-F1-C1, Split-receipting and Deemed Fair Market Value.

**Electronic Receipts Update:**
Effective on registration of the amended Regulation, charities will be allowed to issue donation receipts electronically, if they contain all required information, they are issued in a secure and non-editable format, and the charity maintains an electronic copy of the receipts.

#### Line 311 – Charitable Donations

Complete Schedule 2, Charitable Donations and Gifts, if, during the tax year, you made charitable donations, or unused charitable donations were transferred from a predecessor corporation after amalgamation or from a subsidiary corporation after wind-up.

**Qualified Donees:**
You can claim a deduction from net income for charitable donations made to any of the following qualified donees:
- Registered charities (including registered national arts service organizations)
- Registered journalism organizations
- Registered Canadian amateur athletic associations
- Registered housing corporations resident in Canada set up only to provide low-cost housing for the aged
- Registered Canadian municipalities
- Registered municipal or public bodies performing a function of government in Canada
- The United Nations or its agencies
- Universities outside Canada, of which the student body ordinarily includes students from Canada, that are registered with the CRA
- Registered foreign charities to which His Majesty in right of Canada had made a gift
- His Majesty in right of Canada, a province, or a territory

**References:**
- Subsections 149(1) and 149.1(1)

**Deduction Limit:**
The maximum amount of charitable donations that a corporation can deduct is equal to 75% of its net income (line 300).

This limitation can be increased by the following amounts:
- 25% of the taxable capital gains arising from gifts of capital property made in the year and included in taxable income for the year; this amount is multiplied by the eligible amount of the gift divided by the corporation's proceeds of disposition for the gift
- 25% of all taxable capital gains in the year from the disposition in a previous year of a non-qualifying security of a corporation that is making a gift to a qualified donee
- 25% of whichever is less:
  - The amount of recapture, included in the income of the year, arising from the donation of a prescribed class of depreciable property
  - The eligible amount of the gift divided by the corporation's proceeds of disposition for the gift, multiplied by the lesser of the capital cost and the proceeds of disposition of the property minus any outlays and expenses made for the purpose of making the disposition

**Ordering Rules:**
Charitable donations are deducted in the order they were made (first-in, first-out rule).

**Carry Forward Provision:**
If you are reporting nil net income or a loss for the year, you cannot claim donations to create or increase a loss. However, you can carry forward unused charitable donations and claim them in any of the five following tax years.

**Acquisition of Control Adjustment:**
On line 255 of Schedule 2, enter the amount of any other adjustments (these adjustments would apply to corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control and whose donations carryforward that accrued before the acquisition of control are not deductible after the acquisition of control).

**Schedule 2 Completion:**
- Complete Part 1 of Schedule 2 to calculate the total donations available and the charitable donations closing balance
- Complete Part 2 of Schedule 2 to calculate the maximum deduction allowable and to determine the amount to claim for charitable donations including gifts of capital property
- On line 311, enter the amount you want to deduct in calculating taxable income. This amount cannot be more than the lesser of:
  - The total donations available
  - The maximum deduction allowable
- Complete Part 6 of Schedule 2 to establish the continuity of charitable donations

**Record Keeping:**
You do not have to file receipts with your return. However, you have to keep them in case the CRA asks for them later.

**Special Notes:**
- When a credit union calculates its income for purposes of the 75% limit, it has to add back any amounts it previously deducted for bonus interest payments and payments for allocations in proportion to borrowing
- Where a corporation makes a gift of a non-qualifying security, that gift has to be ignored for the charitable donations deduction. However, if the donee disposes of the security within 60 months, for consideration other than another non-qualifying security of any person, or the security ceases to be a non-qualifying security of the corporation within 60 months, the corporation will be treated as having made the gift at that later time

**Non-Qualifying Security Definition:**
A non-qualifying security generally includes:
- An obligation of the corporation or a non-arm's length person
- A share of the corporation or a share issued by a corporation with which the corporation does not deal at arm's length
- The corporation's beneficial interest in a trust in certain circumstances
- Any other security issued by the corporation or a non-arm's length person

Specifically excepted from this definition are obligations, shares, and other securities listed on designated stock exchanges and deposits with financial institutions.

**Gifts to Canada:**
The eligible amount of gifts to Canada, a province, or a territory is deductible on line 311 as charitable gifts under paragraph 110.1(1)(a). Monetary gifts to Canada should be made payable to the Receiver General for Canada. Send the gift, along with a note stating that the money is a gift to Canada, to:

```
Place du Portage
Phase III
11 Laurier Street
Gatineau QC K1A 0S5
```

If you made such a gift, you should have been provided with an official donation receipt.

- Subsections 40(1.01), 110.1(1.1), and 248(31)

#### Line 313 – Cultural Gifts

Complete Part 3 of Schedule 2 if, during the tax year, one of the following occurred:
- You donated cultural gifts
- The cultural gifts were transferred from a predecessor corporation after amalgamation or from a subsidiary corporation after wind-up

You can claim a deduction from net income for a gift of certified cultural property that you made to a designated institution or public authority. The most you can deduct is the total eligible amount of the gifts donated in the current tax year and any undeducted amounts from the five previous years.

**Carry Forward Provision:**
If the eligible amount of cultural gifts is more than your net income for the year minus other donations you claim, you can carry the excess forward for up to five years.

**Recent Legislative Change:**
Donations made after March 18, 2019, no longer require that property be of national importance (that is, have a direct connection with Canada's cultural heritage) to qualify for the enhanced tax incentives for donations of cultural property. Enhanced tax incentives include an enhanced charitable donation deduction and an income tax exemption for any capital gains arising on the disposition of the property.

**Tax Shelter Rules:**
If the certified cultural property is acquired as part of a gifting arrangement that is a tax shelter, the fair market value (FMV) of the property is deemed to be the lesser of the FMV of the property otherwise determined and its cost to the donor. For more information about the deemed FMV rule, see Pamphlet P113, Gifts and Income Tax, and Income Tax Folio S7-F1-C1, Split-receipting and Deemed Fair Market Value.

**Acquisition of Control Adjustment:**
On line 455 of Schedule 2, enter the amount of any other adjustments (these adjustments would apply to corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control and whose donations carryforward that accrued before the acquisition of control are not deductible after the acquisition of control).

**Ordering Rules:**
Cultural gifts are deducted in the order they were made (first-in, first-out rule).

**Line 313 Entry:**
On line 313, enter the eligible amount for cultural gifts you want to deduct in calculating taxable income.

**Schedule 2 Completion:**
Complete Part 6 of Schedule 2 to establish the continuity of cultural gifts.

You can claim a deduction from net income for certified ecological gifts made to:
- Canada, a province, or a territory
- An approved Canadian municipality or municipal or public body performing a function of government in Canada
- An approved registered charity (other than a private foundation)

**Definition of Ecological Gift:**
An ecological gift is a gift of land (including a covenant, an easement, or, in the case of land in Quebec, a personal servitude that runs for at least 100 years or a real servitude) that is certified by the minister of Environment and Climate Change (ECC) as ecologically sensitive.

**Valuation Rules:**
The eligible amount of a gift of ecologically sensitive land and, consequently, the corporate donor's proceeds of disposition are considered to be the amount determined by the minister of ECC.

**Protection Requirements:**
Ecologically sensitive land must be protected and should not be used for other purposes. A tax of 50% of the fair market value of the land will be charged to recipients who change the use of the land or dispose of it without the consent of the minister of ECC.

**Deduction Limit:**
The maximum deduction you can claim is the total of ecological gifts made during the current tax year plus the unclaimed ecological gifts from the 10 previous tax years, if the gift was made on or after February 11, 2014.

**Carry Forward Provision:**
If the amount of ecological gifts is more than your net income for the year minus any other donations you claim, you can carry the excess forward for up to 10 years.

**Acquisition of Control Adjustment:**
On line 555 of Schedule 2, enter the amount of any other adjustments (these adjustments would apply to corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control and whose donations carryforward amounts that built up before the acquisition of control are not deductible after the acquisition of control).

**Ordering Rules:**
Deduct ecological gifts in the order they were made (first-in, first-out rule).

**Line 314 Entry:**
On line 314, enter the amount of ecological gifts you want to deduct in calculating taxable income.

**Schedule 2 Completion:**
Complete Part 6 of Schedule 2 to establish the continuity of ecological gifts.

### Line 320 – Taxable Dividends Deductible Under Section 112 or 113, or Subsection 138(6)

Complete Schedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable Dividends Paid, and Part IV Tax Calculation, if you either received or paid dividends. For details on how to complete Schedule 3, see Parts 3 and 4 of Schedule 3 on page 82 and "Line 712 – Part IV tax payable" on page 95.

**General Deduction Rules:**
Section 112 and subsection 138(6) of the Act allow corporations that receive intercorporate dividends to claim a deduction equal to the amount of dividends received.

**Recent Legislative Change for Financial Institutions:**
The dividend received deduction under subsections 112(1), 112(2), and 138(6) will be denied for any dividends received or deemed received (if the shares were held by the financial institution) after 2023 by a corporation that is a financial institution (as defined in 142.2(1)). This applies to shares that are mark-to-market (MTM) property or tracking property of the corporation (or that would be MTM property of the corporation for the year if the share was held at any time in the year by the corporation).

**Exception:**
As an exception, this measure does not generally apply to dividends received on taxable preferred shares (as defined in the Income Tax Act).

**Definitions:**
- Shares are considered MTM property when a financial institution holds less than 10% of the vote or value of the corporation that issued the shares
- A tracking property is a property the fair market value of which is determined by reference to certain attributes of another property that would be MTM property if held directly by the corporation

**Deductible Dividend Types:**
When calculating taxable income, you can deduct, under section 112, any of the following types of taxable dividends received:
- Dividends from a taxable Canadian corporation, or from a corporation resident in Canada and controlled by the receiving corporation
- Dividends (or a portion of them) from a non-resident corporation (other than a foreign affiliate) that has
