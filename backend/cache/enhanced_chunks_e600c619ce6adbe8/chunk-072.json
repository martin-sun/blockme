This provision allows corporations to exempt a portion of dividends paid on taxable preferred shares from Part VI.1 tax liability.\n\n### Basic Dividend Allowance\n- The standard annual exemption is $500,000 of dividends paid on taxable preferred shares\n- This exemption applies to dividends paid during the taxation year\n- The allowance is automatically available unless reduced by previous year's dividend payments\n\n### Reduction of Dividend Allowance\nThe $500,000 dividend allowance is reduced when:\n- The corporation paid more than $1 million in dividends on taxable preferred shares in the previous taxation year\n- The reduction is calculated proportionally based on the excess amount over $1 million\n\n### Calculation Method\n1. Determine if dividends paid on taxable preferred shares in the previous year exceeded $1 million\n2. If yes, calculate the reduction amount\n3. Subtract the reduction from the $500,000 basic allowance\n4. The result is the allowable dividend exemption for the current year\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Full Dividend Allowance\nABC Corporation paid $750,000 in dividends on taxable preferred shares in the current year. In the previous year, they paid $800,000 in such dividends.\n\nCalculation:\n- Previous year dividends ($800,000) < $1 million threshold\n- No reduction applies\n- Full $500,000 dividend allowance available\n- $750,000 - $500,000 = $250,000 subject to Part VI.1 tax\n\n#### Example 2: Reduced Dividend Allowance\nXYZ Corporation paid $600,000 in dividends on taxable preferred shares in the current year. In the previous year, they paid $1.5 million in such dividends.\n\nCalculation:\n- Previous year dividends ($1.5 million) > $1 million threshold\n- Excess amount: $1.5 million - $1 million = $500,000\n- Reduction amount: $500,000 × ($500,000 ÷ $1 million) = $250,000\n- Reduced dividend allowance: $500,000 - $250,000 = $250,000\n- $600,000 - $250,000 = $350,000 subject to Part VI.1 tax\n\n### Implementation Considerations for Developers\nWhen building tax applications to calculate the dividend allowance:\n\n1. **Data Requirements**:\n   - Total dividends paid on taxable preferred shares in the current year\n   - Total dividends paid on taxable preferred shares in the previous year\n\n2. **Calculation Logic**:\n   ```python\n   def calculate_dividend_allowance(current_year_dividends, previous_year_dividends):\n       basic_allowance = 500000\n       threshold = 1000000\n       \n       if previous_year_dividends <= threshold:\n           return basic_allowance\n       \n       excess = previous_year_dividends - threshold\n       reduction = excess * (basic_allowance / threshold)\n       return max(0, basic_allowance - reduction)\n   ```\n\n3. **Validation Rules**:\n   - Ensure dividend amounts are non-negative\n   - Verify that only dividends on taxable preferred shares are included\n   - Confirm the previous year data corresponds to the immediately preceding taxation year\n\n4. **Output Requirements**:\n   - Calculated dividend allowance amount\n   - Amount of dividends subject to Part VI.1 tax\n   - Reduction amount (if applicable)\n\n### Related Forms and Schedules\n- Schedule 43: Designation of Dividends Paid on Taxable Preferred Shares\n- T2 Corporation Income Tax Return: Schedule 43 is filed with the T2 return",
