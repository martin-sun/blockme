**Chapter 11**

## Section 34.2 Reporting Requirements

### Schedule 73 and Schedule 6 Coordination
Corporations must ensure consistency between Schedule 73 and Schedule 6 when reporting taxable capital gains. Specifically:

- The amount entered on line 275 of Schedule 73 (total taxable capital gains under section 34.2) must be identical to the corresponding amount reported on Schedule 6
- This cross-referencing ensures accurate calculation of taxable income and prevents discrepancies in tax assessments

**Example:** If Corporation A reports $50,000 in taxable capital gains on line 275 of Schedule 73, the same $50,000 must be reported on Schedule 6. Failure to match these amounts may trigger CRA reviews and potential penalties.

**References:** Sections 34.2, 34.3, and 249.1

## Late Filing Penalties

### Standard Late Filing Penalties
When a corporation files its T2 return after the deadline, the following penalties apply:

- Base penalty: 5% of unpaid tax at the filing deadline
- Additional penalty: 1% of unpaid tax for each complete month the return is late (maximum 12 months)

**Example:** Corporation B owes $100,000 in taxes and files 4 months late. The penalty would be:
- Base penalty: $5,000 (5% of $100,000)
- Additional penalty: $4,000 (1% × 4 months × $100,000)
- Total penalty: $9,000

### Enhanced Penalties for Repeat Late Filers
If the CRA issued a demand to file under subsection 150(2) and assessed a failure-to-file penalty in any of the three previous tax years:

- Base penalty: 10% of unpaid tax at the filing deadline
- Additional penalty: 2% of unpaid tax for each complete month the return is late (maximum 20 months)

**Example:** Corporation C owes $100,000 in taxes, has a history of late filing, and files 4 months late. The penalty would be:
- Base penalty: $10,000 (10% of $100,000)
- Additional penalty: $8,000 (2% × 4 months × $100,000)
- Total penalty: $18,000

**References:** Subsections 162(1) and 162(2)

### Non-resident Corporation Penalties
Non-resident corporations face penalties equal to the greater of:
- The amount calculated under subsections 162(1) or (2) (as described above)
- The greater of $100 or $25 for each complete day the return is late (maximum 100 days)

**Example:** Non-resident Corporation D files 30 days late with $50,000 in unpaid tax:
- Standard penalty calculation: $5,000 (5% of $50,000) + $1,500 (1% × 30 days × $50,000) = $6,500
- Alternative calculation: $25 × 30 days = $750
- Applied penalty: $6,500 (greater of the two calculations)

**Reference:** Subsection 162(2.1)

### Large Corporation Penalties
Large corporations (taxable capital > $10 million) face additional penalties for late filing of T2 returns and Schedule 38:

- Penalty per month: 0.0005% of taxable capital employed in Canada + 0.25% of Part VI tax payable
- Maximum period: 40 months

**Example:** Large Corporation E with $500 million taxable capital and $1 million Part VI tax files 5 months late:
- Monthly penalty: ($500,000,000 × 0.0005%) + ($1,000,000 × 0.25%) = $2,500 + $2,500 = $5,000
- Total penalty: $5,000 × 5 months = $25,000

**Note:** A corporation is considered large if its total taxable capital employed in Canada (including related corporations) exceeds $10 million. Use Schedule 33, 34, or 35 to determine this.

**Reference:** Section 235

## Other Compliance Penalties

### Mandatory Electronic Filing Penalties
Corporations required to file electronically but fail to do so face a $1,000 penalty.

**Reference:** Subsection 162(7.2)

### Failure to Report Income Penalties
When a corporation fails to report an amount of $500 or more in the current year or any of the three previous years:

- Penalty equals the lesser of:
  - 10% of the unreported amount
  - 50% of the difference between understated tax payable and tax withheld on the unreported amount

**Example:** Corporation F fails to report $10,000 of income, resulting in $2,000 of additional tax payable and $500 of tax withheld:
- 10% of unreported amount: $1,000
- 50% of difference: 50% × ($2,000 - $500) = $750
- Applied penalty: $750 (lesser of the two amounts)

**Note:** This penalty doesn't apply if the corporation is already liable under subsection 163(2) for the same amount.

**References:** Subsections 163(1) and 163(1.1)

### False Statements or Omissions Penalties
When a corporation knowingly or through gross negligence makes false statements or omissions:

- Penalty equals the greater of:
  - $100
  - 50% of the understated tax amount

**Example:** Corporation G makes a false statement resulting in $10,000 of understated tax:
- Minimum penalty: $100
- 50% of understated tax: $5,000
- Applied penalty: $5,000 (greater of the two amounts)

**Note:** If charged under subsection 163(2), the corporation cannot also be charged under subsection 163(1) for the same amount.

**Reference:** Subsection 163(2)

### Third-Party Misrepresentation Penalties
Individuals who advise or assist others in filing false returns or knowingly allow submission of false tax information face penalties.

### Tax Debt Avoidance Penalties
Under proposed changes effective April 15, 2024:

**Reference:** Subsection 160(6)

### Other Information Return Penalties
