## General Tax Reduction

### Overview
A general tax reduction of 13% is available on qualifying income for corporations. This reduction applies only to taxable income subject to the federal tax rate of 38%.

### Eligibility Criteria
Corporations can claim the general tax reduction on income that:
- Is taxed at the full 38% federal rate
- Does not receive preferential tax treatment

### Income Types Excluded from the Reduction
The reduction does not apply to:

#### Preferential Tax Treatment Income
- Income eligible for the small business deduction
- Canadian manufacturing and processing profits
- Income eligible for the deduction for generation of electrical energy for sale
- Income eligible for the deduction for production of steam for sale
- Investment income subject to refundable tax provisions

#### Special Business Types
- Income earned from a personal services business
- Income earned by corporations that were, throughout the year:
  - Investment corporations
  - Mortgage investment corporations
  - Mutual fund corporations

#### Example
If a corporation has $100,000 of general business income taxed at 38% and $50,000 of small business income taxed at 9%, the general tax reduction would only apply to the $100,000:
- General tax reduction = $100,000 × 13% = $13,000
