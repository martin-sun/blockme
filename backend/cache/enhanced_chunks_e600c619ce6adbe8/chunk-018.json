This rule prevents taxpayers from using a hobby farm or a small-scale farming operation to generate significant losses against their other sources of income (e.g., employment or business income).\n\n### Current-Year Restricted Farm Loss\n\nThe amount of the farm loss that can be deducted against other income in the current year is restricted. The deductible amount is the lesser of:\na) The actual farm loss calculated on Form `T2042 Statement of Farming Activities`.\nb) The maximum allowable loss, calculated as:\n   **$2,500 + (25% of farming income, if any) + (12.5% of net income from all other sources)**\n\n#### Practical Example\n\n*   **Taxpayer Profile:** An individual with a full-time job.\n*   **Other Income (Employment):** $80,000\n*   **Farming Activities:** Reports a loss of $20,000 on Form `T2042`.\n\n**Calculation of Deductible Loss:**\n\n1.  **Actual Farm Loss:** $20,000\n2.  **Maximum Allowable Loss:**\n    *   Base amount: $2,500\n    *   25% of farming income (income is $0): $0\n    *   12.5% of net income from other sources (12.5% of $80,000): $10,000\n    *   **Total Maximum Allowable Loss:** $2,500 + $0 + $10,000 = **$12,500**\n\n**Result:** The taxpayer can only deduct **$12,500** against their employment income for the current year. The remaining $7,500 ($20,000 - $12,500) is lost and cannot be carried back or forward.\n\n### Continuity and Carryback of Restricted Farm Losses\n\nOnce a loss is characterized as a \"restricted farm loss\" in the year it is incurred, it maintains that character for all subsequent carryback and carryforward years.\n\n#### Carryback Process\n\nA taxpayer can carry back a restricted farm loss for up to three preceding taxation years to reduce their taxable income in those years.\n\n1.  **Determine the Carryback Amount:** Use the deductible amount calculated in the current year (e.g., the $12,500 from the example above).\n2.  **File Form T1139:** To request a carryback, the taxpayer must complete and file `Form T1139, Request for Loss Carryback`. This form is filed with the `T1 General Income Tax and Benefit Return` for the year in which the loss was incurred.\n3.  **Application of Loss:** The loss is applied against net income from all sources in the carryback year, not just farming income.\n\n#### Practical Example (Continued)\n\n*   The taxpayer with the $12,500 restricted farm loss in 2023 decides to carry it back to the 2021 taxation year.\n*   Their 2021 net income was $75,000.\n*   After filing `T1139`, their 2021 net income is reduced to $62,500 ($75,000 - $12,500).\n*   The CRA will reassess the 2021 tax year and issue a refund for the overpaid tax.\n\n### Implementation Notes for Tax Applications\n\nWhen building logic for restricted farm losses, consider the following:\n\n*   **Primary Income Source Check:** The first step is to determine if farming is the taxpayer's chief source of income.\n    *   **If YES:** The loss is a regular farm loss (a non-capital loss) and is fully deductible against all other income without restriction.\n    *   **If NO:** The restricted farm loss rules apply.\n*   **Calculation Logic:** Implement the formula for the maximum allowable loss. Ensure all components (base amount, farming income percentage, other income percentage) are correctly calculated.\n*   **Data Persistence:** When a loss is calculated as a restricted farm loss, it must be flagged and stored as such in the application's database. This flag is critical for correctly processing carrybacks and carryforwards.\n*   **Form Integration:**\n    *   The initial loss is derived from the data entered on `Form T2042`.\n    *   The carryback process should trigger the generation or population of `Form T1139`.\n*   **Carryforward Logic:** Any portion of a restricted farm loss that is not used in the current year or carried back is carried forward indefinitely as a non-capital loss. In future years, it can be applied against any type of income.",
