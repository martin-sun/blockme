## Part 3 – Farm Losses

### Overview
Use this section to establish the continuity of farm losses and to carry back a current-year farm loss to previous tax years. Farm losses include losses from farming and fishing businesses.

**Important Note**: Farm losses expire after 20 tax years following the year of the loss.

### Line-by-Line Instructions

#### Line 305: Transferred Farm Losses
This line represents the amount of farm losses transferred from:
- A predecessor corporation after amalgamation, or
- A subsidiary after wind-up

**Eligibility Requirement**: Not less than 90% of the issued shares in each class must have been owned by the corporation immediately before the wind-up.

**Calculation Method**:
```
Unused farm losses available at year-end of predecessor/subsidiary
- Any expired amounts
= Amount to enter on Line 305
```

**Example**: 
If Corporation A acquired 95% of Corporation B's shares, and Corporation B had $50,000 in unused farm losses with no expired amounts, Corporation A would enter $50,000 on Line 305.

#### Line 340: Debt Forgiveness Adjustments
Enter any amount of debt forgiveness under section 80 that reduces the farm losses balance.

**Important**: Losses must be reduced in the specific order established by section 80 of the Income Tax Act.

#### Line 350: Other Adjustments
Include any other adjustments not previously mentioned, particularly for corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control where losses accrued before the acquisition are not deductible afterward.

### Final Calculation

#### Line 380: Closing Balance
The result of this section is the closing balance of farm losses to carry forward to future years.

### Next Steps

Complete Part 6 to establish the balance of farm losses by year of origin, which is essential for tracking the 20-year expiration period of each loss.
