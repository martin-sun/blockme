Its primary purpose is to integrate the federal and provincial/territorial tax systems, preventing a higher overall tax burden and providing a base level of reduction that recognizes provincial tax levied on the same income.\n\nThis reduction is calculated as a percentage of the corporation's taxable income, after deducting a specified amount for the provincial or territorial tax system (the \"abatement\").\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n*   **Non-Refundable Credit:** The General Tax Reduction can reduce federal tax payable to zero, but it cannot create a refund. Any unused portion of the credit is lost.\n*   **Part I Tax:** This is the base federal tax calculated on taxable income before most other tax credits are applied. The General Tax Reduction is one of the first credits applied against this amount.\n*   **Provincial/Territorial Abatement:** This is not a credit itself, but a deduction from taxable income used *only* for the purpose of calculating the General Tax Reduction. It represents a percentage of taxable income intended to account for provincial/territorial taxes.\n\n### Calculation Methodology\n\nThe General Tax Reduction is calculated by applying a specific percentage to the corporation's taxable income after the abatement is deducted.\n\n**Formula:**\n`General Tax Reduction = (Taxable Income - Abatement) × General Rate Reduction Percentage`\n\n#### 1. Determine the Provincial/Territorial Abatement\nThe abatement rate depends on the corporation's province or territory of residence at the end of the tax year.\n\n| Province/Territory | Abatement Rate |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| All provinces (except Quebec) & Yukon | 10% |\n| Quebec            | 16% |\n| Nunavut           | 0% |\n| Northwest Territories | 0% |\n| Non-resident corporation | 0% |\n\n#### 2. Apply the General Rate Reduction Percentage\nThe percentage applied is generally **15%**. This rate is applied to the taxable income remaining after the abatement is deducted.\n\n### Practical Example\n\n**Scenario:**\n*   **Corporation:** \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n*   **Tax Year End:** December 31, 2023\n*   **Province of Residence:** Ontario\n*   **Taxable Income (Line 360 of T2):** $250,000\n*   **Income Type:** General rate income (not eligible for the small business deduction).\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Abatement:**\n    *   Ontario's abatement rate is 10%.\n    *   Abatement Amount = $250,000 × 10% = $25,000\n\n2.  **Calculate Reduced Taxable Income:**\n    *   Reduced Taxable Income = $250,000 (Taxable Income) - $25,000 (Abatement) = $225,000\n\n3.  **Calculate the General Tax Reduction:**\n    *   General Rate Reduction Percentage = 15%\n    *   General Tax Reduction = $225,000 × 15% = **$33,750**\n\n**Result:**\nTech Solutions Inc. can claim a General Tax Reduction of $33,750 on **Schedule 1, Line 607** of its T2 return. This amount is directly deducted from its federal Part I tax payable.\n\n### Implementation Notes for Developers\n\nWhen building logic for the T2 General Tax Reduction, consider the following:\n\n*   **Required Inputs:**\n    *   `taxableIncome`: The total taxable income from the T2 return (Line 360).\n    *   `provinceOrTerritory`: The corporation's province or territory of residence at year-end.\n    *   `isNonResident`: A boolean flag to determine if the 0% rate applies.\n\n*   **Calculation Logic:**\n    1.  Determine the `abatementRate` based on the `provinceOrTerritory` input.\n    2.  Calculate `abatementAmount` = `taxableIncome` × `abatementRate`.\n    3.  Calculate `reducedTaxableIncome` = `taxableIncome` - `abatementAmount`.\n    4.  Calculate `generalTaxReduction` = `reducedTaxableIncome` × 0.15.\n    5.  The final credit to be applied is the lesser of the calculated reduction and the total Part I tax payable.\n        `finalCredit = min(generalTaxReduction, partITaxPayable)`\n\n*   **Form Integration:**\n    *   The calculated `finalCredit` value must be mapped to **Schedule 1, Federal Tax, Line 607 - General tax reduction**.\n    *   Ensure the calculation respects the non-refundable nature of the credit.",
