The reduction amount depends on the relationship between the corporations:\n\n### Calculation Methods:\n- **Non-connected corporation**: 10% of the dividend amount\n- **Connected corporation**: 30% of the Part IV tax payable\n\n### Practical Example:\nIf Corporation A receives a $100,000 dividend from a non-connected corporation, the Part IV tax reduction would be $10,000 (10% of $100,000).\n\nIf Corporation A receives the same dividend from a connected corporation and the Part IV tax payable is $15,000, the Part IV tax reduction would be $4,500 (30% of $15,000).\n\n## Part IV.1 Tax Payable\n\nOn line 716 of the T2 Corporation Income Tax Return, enter the amount of Part IV.1 tax payable calculated on line 340 of Schedule 43.\n\n## Part VI Tax Payable\n\nFinancial institutions must complete Schedule 38, Part VI Tax on Capital of Financial Institutions, to calculate Part VI tax.\n\n### Tax Calculation:\nPart VI tax is 1.25% of the taxable capital employed in Canada that exceeds the $1 billion capital deduction for the year.\n\n### For Related Groups:\nIf the corporation is a member of a related group, the capital deduction must be allocated among members using Schedule 39, Agreement Among Related Financial Institutions – Part VI Tax.\n\n### Filing Requirements:\n- File Schedule 39 with your return\n- Only one associated or related corporation needs to file Schedule 39 for a calendar year\n- If Schedule 39 is not on file when the CRA assesses returns, it may request one\n\n### Financial Institutions Definition:\nFinancial institutions include:\n- Banks\n- Trust companies\n- Life insurance corporations\n- Certain holding corporations\n- Corporations that accept deposits and lend money on real property security\n- Corporations investing in mortgage or hypothec indebtedness\n\nOn line 720, enter the amount of Part VI tax payable calculated on line 890 of Schedule 38.\n\n## Part I Tax Credit for Part VI Tax\n\nUnder subsection 190.1(3), corporations can deduct Part I tax payable for the year from Part VI tax payable. This is known as the Part I tax credit.\n\n### Credit Carryback and Carryforward:\n- Unused Part I tax credits can be carried back 3 years\n- Unused Part I tax credits can be carried forward 7 years\n- Use Schedule 42, Calculation of Unused Part I Tax Credit, to calculate and carry back this credit\n\n### Practical Example:\nIf a financial institution has $50,000 of Part VI tax payable and $30,000 of Part I tax payable, it can claim a $30,000 Part I tax credit, reducing its Part VI tax to $20,000. If the institution only uses $20,000 of this credit, the remaining $10,000 can be carried back or forward as specified.\n\n## Part VI.1 Tax Payable\n\nComplete the following schedules if required:\n- Schedule 43, Calculation of Parts IV.1 and VI.1 Taxes\n- Schedule 45, Agreement Respecting Liability for Part VI.1 Tax\n\n## Implementation Notes for Developers\n\nWhen building tax applications for these credits:\n\n1. **Part IV Tax Reduction Logic**:\n   ```javascript\n   function calculatePartIVTaxReduction(dividendAmount, isFromConnectedCorp, partIVTaxPayable) {\n     if (isFromConnectedCorp) {\n       return partIVTaxPayable * 0.30;\n     } else {\n       return dividendAmount * 0.10;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Part VI Tax Calculation**:\n   ```javascript\n   function calculatePartVITax(taxableCapitalInCanada, capitalDeduction = 1000000000) {\n     const excessCapital = Math.max(0, taxableCapitalInCanada - capitalDeduction);\n     return excessCapital * 0.0125; // 1.25%\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Part I Tax Credit Carryforward/Carryback**:\n   ```javascript\n   function calculatePartICreditCarryforward(unusedCredits, currentYear, carrybackYears = 3, carryforwardYears = 7) {\n     return {\n       carrybackPeriod: {\n         startYear: currentYear - carrybackYears,\n         endYear: currentYear - 1\n       },\n       carryforwardPeriod: {\n         startYear: currentYear + 1,\n         endYear: currentYear + carryforwardYears\n       },\n       availableCredits: unusedCredits\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Required Schedules Mapping**:\n   - Part IV.1 Tax: Schedule 43 (line 340)\n   - Part VI Tax: Schedule 38 (line 890)\n   - Part I Tax Credit: Schedule 42\n   - Related Group Allocation: Schedule 39\n   - Part VI.1 Tax: Schedule 43 and Schedule 45\n\n5. **Validation Rules**:\n   - Verify corporation type before applying Part VI tax\n   - Check for related group membership to determine if Schedule 39 is required\n   - Ensure Part IV tax reduction only applies when Part IV.1 tax is payable on the same dividend\n\n## References\n- Sections 187.1 to 187.6\n- Subsections 186(1.1) and 191.2(1)\n- Sections 190, 190.1, and 190.11 to 190.15",
