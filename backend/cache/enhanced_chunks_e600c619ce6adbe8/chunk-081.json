Applications should guide users through this official pathway.\n\n### Recommended Resolution Pathway\n\nThe CRA recommends a tiered approach to resolving inquiries efficiently.\n\n#### 1. Initial Contact with the Assigned Officer\nThe first and most direct step is to resolve the matter with the specific CRA employee who handled the file. Their contact information is typically included in the correspondence related to the credit.\n\n*   **Action:** Attempt to call or write to the employee whose name appears on the document.\n*   **Example:** A taxpayer's application for the **Canada Caregiver Credit (CCC)** was adjusted, resulting in a lower-than-expected refund. The Notice of Reassessment includes a contact name and extension. The taxpayer should contact this officer first to understand why the credit was reduced and what documentation is needed to correct it.\n\n#### 2. Use General Correspondence Contact Information\nIf the assigned officer is unreachable or if no specific name is provided, use the general telephone number listed on the correspondence.\n\n*   **Action:** Call the main business or individual enquiries number provided on the letter or notice.\n*   **Required Information:** Taxpayers must have their Social Insurance Number (SIN), the tax year, and the reference number from the correspondence ready before calling.\n\n#### 3. General CRA Contact Channels\nIf no specific contact information is available, taxpayers must navigate to the CRA's general contact portal to find the appropriate phone number or mailing address for their inquiry.\n\n*   **Action:** Direct users to the official CRA contact page.\n*   **Resource:** [canada.ca/cra-contact](https://canada.ca/cra-contact)\n\n### Developer Implementation Notes\n\nFor developers building tax applications, integrating this dispute resolution process is crucial for user support and compliance.\n\n*   **User Guidance Flow:** When displaying a credit calculation or assessment, include a clear call-to-action (CTA) such as \"Question about this credit?\". This should link to a help screen outlining the three-step resolution process above.\n*   **Data Checklists:** Before prompting a user to contact the CRA, display a checklist of required information to have on hand:\n    *   Social Insurance Number (SIN)\n    *   Tax Year of the credit\n    *   Notice of Assessment (NOA) or other relevant CRA correspondence\n    *   Specific details of the credit in question (e.g., name, amount claimed)\n*   **Deep Linking:** Where possible, link directly to the most relevant CRA contact page. For credit-specific inquiries, this may be the \"Business enquiries\" or \"Individual enquiries\" sections of the CRA contact page. Always open external links in a new tab to preserve the user's session in your application.\n*   **Error Logging:** If a user initiates a dispute or inquiry flow from your app, consider securely logging the nature of their issue (e.g., \"Disputed DTC amount\"). This anonymized data can help identify common user pain points or potential bugs in your application's credit calculation logic.",
