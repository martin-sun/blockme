For straight-line method assets, enter N/A.\n\n**Declining Balance Method Example:**\n- Asset cost: $780,000\n- Rate: 10% with half-year rule\n- First year: $780,000 × 10% ÷ 2 = $39,000 CCA\n- Second year: ($780,000 - $39,000) × 10% = $74,100 CCA\n\n#### Column 21 – Recapture of CCA\nEnter recapture amount from column 10. Include as income on line 107 of Schedule 1.\n\n**Note:** Recapture rules don't apply to passenger vehicles in class 10.1, but do apply to passenger vehicles that were DIEP.\n\n**References:** Subsections 13(1) and 13(2)\n\n#### Column 22 – Terminal Loss\nEnter terminal loss from column 10. Deduct from income on line 404 of Schedule 1.\n\n**Terminal loss rules don't apply to:**\n- Passenger vehicles in class 10.1\n- Property in class 14.1 (unless business discontinued)\n- Limited-period franchises in class 14 (with certain conditions)\n\n**Reference:** Subsection 20(16.1)\n\n#### Column 23 – CCA\n**Maximum CCA Calculation (declining balance):**\n```\nCCA = (Column 15 + Column 18 - Column 19) × Column 20 + Column 12\n```\n\n**Short Tax Year Adjustment:**\nFor tax years less than 365 days, prorate CCA claim (except for excluded classes):\n```\nProrated CCA = Maximum CCA × (Days in tax year ÷ 365)\n```\n\n**Excluded Classes:** 14, 15, timber limits, cutting rights, industrial mineral mines, certified productions, Canadian film/video productions, certain mining equipment\n\n**Reference:** Regulation 1100(3)\n\n#### Column 24 – UCC at End of Year\n**Calculation:**\n```\nColumn 24 = Column 10 - Column 23\n```\n\nWhen recapture or terminal loss occurs, UCC at year-end is always nil.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Terminal Loss\nA manufacturing business sells its warehouse for $60,000. At year-end, it has no more assets in class 3. Beginning UCC was $65,000.\n\n**Result:** $5,000 terminal loss (deducted on line 404 of Schedule 1)\n\n#### Example 2: Recapture of CCA\nA clothing company sells a sewing machine for $18,000 (capital cost $15,000). Beginning UCC was $6,720.\n\n**Result:** $8,280 recapture (included in income on line 107 of Schedule 1)\n\n#### Example 3: 50% Rule\nA bookstore buys a photocopier for $10,000 from a non-arm's length person. Beginning UCC was $14,000.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Column 19 adjustment: ($10,000 - $0 - $0 + $0 - $0) × 0.5 = $5,000\n- Maximum CCA: ($24,000 + $0 - $5,000) × 20% = $3,800\n\n#### Example 4: Accelerated Investment Incentive Property\nA grocery store buys refrigeration equipment for $20,000 (AIIP). Beginning UCC was $45,000.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Column 18 adjustment: $20,000 × 0.5 = $10,000\n- Maximum CCA: ($65,000 + $10,000 - $0) × 20% = $15,000\n\n#### Example 5: AIIP and Non-AIIP\nA potato producer buys tractors for $200,000, including $50,000 non-AIIP. Beginning UCC was $450,000.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Column 18 adjustment: $150,000 × 0.5 = $75,000\n- Column 19 adjustment: ($50,000 - $0 - $0 + $0 - $0) × 0.5 = $25,000\n- Maximum CCA: ($650,000 + $75,000 - $25,000) × 30% = $210,000\n\n#### Example 6: Designated Immediate Expensing Property (DIEP)\nA new CCPC buys eligible machinery for $1.2 million. No EPOP associations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Immediate expensing: lesser of $1.5 million limit and $1.2 million UCC = $1.2 million\n- CCA claim: $1.2 million (full expensing)\n\n#### Example 7: DIEP and Non-DIEP\nA corporation buys eligible machinery for $2.8 million, with $1.8 million qualifying as DIEP.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Immediate expensing: $1.5 million (limit)\n- Column 18 adjustment: $1.3 million × 0.5 = $650,000\n- Maximum CCA: ($1.3 million + $650,000 - $0) × 30% = $585,000\n- Total CCA: $585,000 + $1.5 million = $2,085,000\n\n---\n\n### Common CCA Classes and Rates\n\n| Class | Description | Rate |\n|-------|-------------|------|\n| 1 | Buildings (brick, stone, cement) acquired after 1987 | 4% |\n| 3 | Buildings acquired before 1988 | 5% |\n| 6 | Frame buildings, fences, greenhouses | 10% |\n| 8 | Furniture, equipment, tools ($500+), outdoor advertising | 20% |\n| 9 | Aircraft and equipment | 25% |\n| 10 | Vehicles, computers, electronic equipment | 30% |\n| 10.1 | Passenger vehicles over cost limit | 30% |\n| 12 | Small tools, software, certain rental property | 100% |\n| 13 | Leasehold interests | n/a |\n| 14 | Limited-period intangible property | n/a |\n| 14.1 | Goodwill, trademarks, unlimited-period intangibles | 5% |\n| 16 | Rental vehicles, taxis, heavy trucks | 40% |\n| 17 | Roads, parking lots, communication equipment | 8% |\n| 29 | Manufacturing equipment (2007-2016) | 50% |\n| 43 | Manufacturing equipment (after 1992) | 30% |\n| 43.1 | Clean energy equipment (10-90kW) | 30% |\n| 43.2 | Clean energy equipment (2005-2025) | 50% |\n| 44 | Patents and licences | 25% |\n| 46 | Data network infrastructure | 30% |\n| 50 | Computer equipment (after 2007) | 55% |\n| 53 | Manufacturing equipment (2016-2026) | 50% |\n| 54 | Zero-emission vehicles (not class 16/55) | 30% |\n| 55 | Zero-emission vehicles (class 16 type) | 40% |\n| 56 | Electric/hydrogen automotive equipment | 30% |\n| 57 | CCUS capture/transport/storage equipment | 8% |\n| 58 | CCUS utilization equipment | 20% |\n| 59 | CCUS geological assessment intangibles | 100% |\n| 60 | CCUS drilling intangibles | 30% |\n\n---\n\n### Related Schedules\n\n#### Schedule 12: Resource-Related Deductions\nComplete if claiming:\n- Canadian exploration expenses (including CRCE)\n- Canadian development expenses\n- Canadian oil and gas property expenses\n- Depletion\n- Foreign exploration and development expenses\n- Specified foreign exploration and development expenses\n- Foreign resource expenses\n\n**Accelerated Investment Incentive:**\nAvailable for eligible CDE and COGPE incurred after November 20, 2018, and before 2028 (phased out after 2023).\n\n#### Schedule 13: Continuity of Reserves\nComplete to show continuity of deductible reserves, including:\n- Prior-year reserves\n- Current-year reserves\n- Reserves transferred from amalgamation or wind-up\n\nIf a reserve was deducted last year, add it to current-year income and establish a new reserve amount.",
