## Information Schedules and Forms

### Schedule 9, Related and Associated Corporations

Complete Schedule 9 if the corporation is related to or associated with at least one other corporation.

**Reference:** Sections 251 and 256

#### When is a corporation associated?

Association is based on control. Control can be exerted either directly or indirectly in any way. A person or a group of persons can control a corporation. In this context, a person can be either an individual or a corporation.

Control includes both de jure control and de facto control:
- **De jure control**: The right of control that depends on a person owning enough shares of a corporation to give that person a majority of the voting power
- **De facto control** (factual control): Occurs when a corporation is subject to any direct or indirect influencing that, if exercised, would result in actual control being exerted

When determining whether a taxpayer has any direct or indirect influence that, if exercised, would result in factual control of the corporation, one must:
- Take into consideration all factors that are relevant in the circumstances
- Not be limited to whether the taxpayer has a legally enforceable right or ability to make a change in the board of directors of the corporation, or the board's power, or to exercise influence over the shareholder(s) who have that right or ability. The previous factors are not mandatory in determining factual control

In general, a corporation is associated with another corporation if it meets one of the following six conditions at any time in the tax year. Remember that controlled means directly or indirectly in any way.

#### Condition 1
The corporations are associated if one corporation controls the other.

**Example:**
Corp X owns 100% of the voting shares of Corp Y, which in turn owns 51% of the voting shares of Corp Z.
- Corp X is associated with Corp Y because it exerts direct control over it
- Corp X is associated with Corp Z because it exerts indirect control over it

#### Condition 2
The corporations are associated if both corporations are controlled by the same person or group of persons.

Corporations may be associated because the same group of persons controls both corporations, but the members of this group do not act together and have no other connection to each other.

CCPCs that are associated only because of this definition of a group will NOT be considered associated when:
- Calculating the refundable investment tax credit on qualified SR&ED expenditures
- Calculating the expenditure limit
- Allocating the expenditure limit

For this exception to apply, one of the corporations must have at least one shareholder who is not common to both corporations. The corporations will continue to be associated for all other purposes of the Income Tax Act.

**Example:**
Bob owns 40% of the voting shares of Corp ABC and 30% of the voting shares of Corp XYZ. Ike owns 20% of the voting shares of Corp ABC and 40% of the voting shares of Corp XYZ.
- As a group, Bob and Ike control both companies
- Corps ABC and XYZ are associated

#### Condition 3
The corporations are associated if all of the following apply:
- Each corporation is controlled by one person
- That person is related to the person controlling the other corporation
- One of those persons owns at least 25% of the issued shares of any class, other than shares of a specified class, of the capital stock of each corporation

**Example:**
Billy owns 100% of the issued share capital of Corp AB. He also owns 25% of the class A shares (other than shares of a specified class) of Corp CD, whose controlling shareholder is Billy's brother.
- Corps AB and CD are associated

#### Condition 4
The corporations are associated if all of the following apply:
- One corporation is controlled by one person
- That person is related to each member of a group of persons who controls the other corporation
- That person owns at least 25% of the issued shares of any class, other than shares of a specified class, of the capital stock of the other corporation

**Example:**
Buddy controls Corp AY. His two daughters control Corp AZ. Buddy also owns 50% of the class A preferred shares of Corp AZ.
- Corps AY and AZ are associated

#### Condition 5
The corporations are associated if all of the following apply:
- Each corporation is controlled by a related group
- Each of the members of one of the related groups is related to all members of the other related group
- One or more persons who are members of both related groups, either alone or together, own at least 25% of the issued shares of any class, other than shares of a specified class, of the capital stock of each corporation

**Example:**
Anne and her two daughters control Corp One. Anne and her two sons control Corp Two. Anne owns 33% of the common shares in each corporation.
- Corps One and Two are associated

#### Condition 6
Under subsection 256(2), two corporations that are not associated with each other will be considered associated if they are associated with the same corporation (the third corporation). Special rules apply for determining the small business deduction. See Schedule 28, Election not to be Associated Through a Third Corporation, on page 34 for details.

**Example:**
Corp AB owns 100% of the issued share capital of Corp CD. It also owns 25% of the class A shares (other than shares of a specified class) of Corp XY, whose controlling shareholder is Billy. Billy's brother controls Corp AB.
- Corps AB, CD, and XY are associated

### Schedule 23, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Business Limit

All CCPCs that are associated have to file Schedule 23. This schedule is used to:
- Identify all the corporations to establish:
  - The date the balance of tax is due (see "Balance-due day" on page 14)
  - The calculation of the reduction to the business limit
- Allocate a percentage of the business limit to each associated corporation. The total of all percentages cannot be more than 100%. The maximum business limit is provided at Line 410 – Business limit, on page 77

**Notes:**
- Only one of the associated or related corporations needs to file Schedule 23 for a calendar year. However, if Schedule 23 is not already on file when the CRA assesses any of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar year of the agreement, it will ask for one
- If the corporation's tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, prorate the business limit allocated in column 400 of Schedule 23 based on the number of days in the tax year divided by 365

#### Associated corporations with more than one tax year in a calendar year

Special rules apply to determine the business limit for associated corporations that have more than one tax year ending in the same calendar year.

For the second or later tax years that end in the same calendar year, the business limit is whichever of the following amounts is less:
- The amount allocated to the corporation for the first tax year
- The amount allocated to the corporation for the later tax year in question

Make sure the total of the business limits of all associated corporations for any tax years that end in the same calendar year is not more than the maximum allowable business limit for that calendar year.

If the corporation's tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, prorate the business limit as determined above, based on the number of days in the tax year divided by 365.

**Example:**
Corp A and Corp B are associated in 2024.
- Corp A's tax year runs from January 1, 2024, to June 30, 2024
- The business limit allocated to Corp A for its June 30, 2024, tax year is $100,000

On November 1, 2024, Corp C becomes associated with Corp A and Corp B. The tax year-end for Corp C is December 31, 2024. Corp A and Corp B change their year-ends to match Corp C's year-end.

The corporations decide to allocate a $300,000 business limit to Corp C for the December 31, 2024, year-end. Because the total of their business limits cannot be more than $500,000, the corporations allocate $90,000 to Corp A and $110,000 to Corp B.

**Question:** What is Corp A's business limit for each of the two tax years ending in the 2024 calendar year?

**Answer:**
Tax year ending June 30, 2024:
- Because the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, Corp A prorates the business limit for the number of days in the tax year as follows:
  $100,000 × 181 days ÷ 365 days = $49,589
  (Note: 365 is not adjusted for a leap year)

Tax year ending December 31, 2024:
- Because the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, Corp A prorates the business limit for the number of days in the tax year. Corp A uses the $90,000 business limit allocated in this tax year, because it is less than the $100,000 business limit allocated in its first tax year ending in 2024
  $90,000 × 184 days ÷ 365 days = $45,370
  (Note: 365 is not adjusted for a leap year)

**Reference:** Subsection 125(5)

### Schedule 49, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Expenditure Limit

All CCPCs that are associated and have scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) expenditures have to file Schedule 49. These corporations use this form to:
- Identify all the associated corporations
- Allocate the expenditure limit for the 35% ITC rate on qualifying SR&ED expenditures

For more details about the ITC, see Lines 652 and 780 on page 88.

**Note:**
- Only one of the associated or related corporations needs to file Schedule 49 for a calendar year. However, if Schedule 49 is not already on file when the CRA assesses any of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar year of the agreement, it will ask for one

#### Associated corporations with more than one tax year in a calendar year

Special rules apply to determine the expenditure limit for associated corporations that have more than one tax year ending in the same calendar year. Prorate the expenditure limit for each tax year ending in the calendar year based on the number of days in the tax year divided by 365.

Be sure that the amount you prorate for each of the tax years is equal to the amount allocated to the corporation for the first tax year ending in the calendar year.

**References:**
- Subsections 127(10.3) and 127(10.6)

### Schedule 28, Election not to be Associated Through a Third Corporation

File Schedule 28 if a CCPC that is associated with two other corporations elects under subsection 256(2) for the two other corporations not to be associated with each other for the purposes of the small business deduction.

**Note:**
- Two corporations (Corps A and B) that are not associated with each other are considered associated under subsection 256(2) if they are associated with the same corporation (the third corporation)
- When the CCPC (the third corporation) makes this election, its business limit for the small business deduction is considered to be zero
- Investment income received from either of the two other corporations' active business will be ineligible for the small business deduction as it will not be treated as active business income
- Corps A and B remain associated with the CCPC. They must include the taxable capital limit of the CCPC when calculating the small business deduction
- The CCPC has to file a new election for each applicable tax year

**Reference:** Subsection 256(2)

### Schedule 19, Non-Resident Shareholder Information

Complete Schedule 19 if a non-resident shareholder owned a voting share of any class of the corporation's capital stock at any time during the tax year. Do not include non-voting shares.

### Schedule 11, Transactions with Shareholders, Officers, or Employees

Generally, the CRA considers all or substantially all to be at least 90%. You have to evaluate all assets at cost or fair market value.

When this kind of non-arm's length transaction takes place, the instalment requirements of the transferee corporation have to take into account those of the transferor corporation.

**Reference:** Regulation 5301(8)

If you are a member of a partnership, attach to your return a list of all the partnership account numbers assigned to the partnerships of which you are a member.

Corporate partners that receive a T5013 information slip do not have to file it with their return. They should keep it in case the CRA asks for it later.

**Notes:**
- Each partnership has to file a T5013 FIN, Partnership Financial Return and T5013 SUM, Information Slips Summary, for each fiscal period. However, some partnerships are exempt from this requirement. For more information, see Guide T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return (T5013 Forms)
- Except where an election is filed under subsection 249.1(4), for the tax year that includes the first day of the first fiscal period of a business, partnerships with at least one member who is an individual, a professional corporation, or another affected partnership have to have a December 31 fiscal period end
- Certain partnerships in a multi-tier partnership structure also have to have a December 31 fiscal period end unless a valid multi-tier alignment election was made to align to a common fiscal period. The eligible period to make this one-time election has ended

### Schedule 22, Non-Resident Discretionary Trust

A corporation that makes payments or credits amounts to non-residents under Regulations 202(1) and/or 105(1) has to file the applicable information return.

#### Thin capitalization rules: Disallowed interest treated as a dividend

Interest disallowed as a deduction under the thin capitalization rules (including amounts paid, credited, or payable to a non-resident by the corporation or by a partnership that the corporation is directly or indirectly a member of) will be deemed to be a dividend paid to the non-resident. As a result, the corporation has to remit Part XIII tax using the rate that applies to dividend payments.

The corporation may designate, on or before its filing due date for the tax year, which amounts paid or credited in the tax year as interest to a particular specified non-resident are to be deemed dividends. The designation may be included with the notes to the financial statements.

### Foreign Property and Foreign Affiliates

**Note:** The foreign affiliate dumping rules are intended to prevent surplus from being stripped out of Canada without tax. For transactions that occur after March 18, 2019, these rules, applicable to corporations resident in Canada controlled by a non-resident corporation, now also apply to corporations resident in Canada that are controlled by a non-resident individual, non-resident trust or group made up of any combination of non-resident corporations, non-resident individuals and non-resident trusts that do not deal with each other at arm's length.

A corporation resident in Canada, of which a non-resident corporation is a foreign affiliate at any time in the year, must file Form T1134, Information Return Relating to Controlled and Not-Controlled Foreign Affiliates. A separate supplement has to be filed for each foreign affiliate.

The corporation has to file Form T1134:
- Within 15 months after the end of its tax year for tax years starting (TYS) before 2020

You can EFILE Form T1134. For more information about filing, see that form.

### Beneficiaries of Non-Resident Trusts

A corporation may have received, in the year, funds or property from, or been indebted to, a non-resident trust in which it had a beneficial interest. If so, you have to complete and file Form T1142, Information Return in Respect of Distributions From and Indebtedness to a Non-Resident Trust.

A separate form has to be filed for each non-resident trust. Form T1142 contains more information about filing.

### Transfers to Non-Resident Trusts

A corporation may have transferred or loaned funds or property to a non-resident trust. If so, you may have to complete and file Form T1141, Information Return in Respect of Contributions to Non-Resident Trusts, Arrangements or Entities.

If the total cost of all such property is less than CAN$250,000 throughout the year, the corporation may use the simplified reporting method included in Form T1135.

**Note:** Specified foreign property does not include, for example:
- Foreign investments held in Canadian mutual funds
- Property you used or held exclusively in the course of carrying on your active business
- A share of the capital stock or indebtedness of a foreign affiliate

For more information on the property you are required to report, see Form T1135 or go to canada.ca/cra-foreign-income-verification.

You can EFILE Form T1135. For more information about filing, see that form.

### Non-Resident Trusts (NRTs) and Offshore Investment Fund Property (OIFP)

NRTs with a resident contributor or a resident beneficiary are deemed to be resident in Canada throughout the year for many purposes under the Act including determining the liability of the trust for tax under Part I. As deemed resident trusts, they will also have the obligation to withhold and remit Part XIII tax on amounts paid to non-residents. However, the deemed resident trusts themselves will not be liable under Part XIII.

Also, the resident contributor and/or resident beneficiary are deemed to be jointly, severally, and solidarily liable for the trust's Canadian tax liability and reporting obligations. This means that a corporation that is a resident contributor or resident beneficiary to a trust is jointly, severally, and solidarily liable for the Canadian tax liability and reporting obligation of that trust.

Corporations with an interest in an OIFP may have to include an amount in their income as determined under the Act.

For more information about NRTs and OIFP, including the specific definitions of resident contributor, resident beneficiary, and offshore investment fund property, call the CRA at one of the following numbers:
- 1-800-959-8281, from Canada and the continental United States
- 613-940-8495, from anywhere else. The CRA only accepts collect calls made through telephone operators. After your call is accepted by an automated response, you may hear a beep and notice a normal connection delay

**References:**
- Section 94.1
- Subsections 94(3) and 94(4)

### Penalties

There are substantial penalties for not completing and filing Forms T1134, T1135, T1141, and T1142 by the due date, and for knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence making false statements or omissions in any of the information returns.

**References:**
- Sections 233.1 to 233.6
- Subsections 162(7), 162(10), 162(10.1), and 163(2.4)
