Under these rules, the corporation must accrue income for the portion of the partnership's fiscal period that falls within the corporation's tax year (the \"stub period\").\n\n**Important Note**: These rules do not affect a corporation's Capital Dividend Account (CDA), which is determined without reference to section 34.2 of the Income Tax Act.\n\n### ASPA Income Inclusion and Deduction Mechanics\n\nSince the ASPA income inclusion in a tax year is an estimate of the stub period income, the corporation is entitled to claim that same amount in the immediately following tax year. Both the ASPA income inclusion and the subsequent claim are subject to the characterization rules under subsection 34.2(5).\n\nThese amounts are deemed to have the same character and be in the same proportions as the partnership income they relate to. Consequently, the claim in the following tax year may be:\n- A deduction\n- A deemed allowable capital loss\n- Or whichever applies based on the nature of the partnership income\n\n**Example**: If a corporation includes $10,000 of ASPA income in 2023, and the partnership income was 60% business income and 40% capital gains, the corporation can claim a $6,000 deduction and $4,000 deemed allowable capital loss in 2024.\n\nA corporation may have ASPA in respect of more than one partnership. In such cases, the ASPA rules apply on a partnership-by-partnership basis.\n\n### When ASPA Applies\n\nA corporation (other than a professional corporation) must include its ASPA for a partnership in its income for a tax year if ALL of the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The corporation has a significant interest in the partnership at the end of the last fiscal period of the partnership that ends in the tax year\n2. Another fiscal period of the partnership begins in the tax year and ends after the corporation's tax year\n3. At the end of the tax year, the corporation is entitled to a share of income, loss, taxable capital gain, or allowable capital loss of the partnership for the fiscal period mentioned in the previous point\n\n### Definition of Significant Interest\n\nA corporation has a significant interest in a partnership if the corporation, or the corporation together with affiliated or related parties, is entitled to more than 10% of the partnership's:\n- Income or loss, OR\n- Assets, net of liabilities (if the partnership were to cease to exist)\n\n**Example**: Corporation A owns 8% of a partnership, and its affiliate Corporation B owns 5%. Together, they own 13%, which exceeds the 10% threshold, giving Corporation A a significant interest in the partnership.\n\n### Applicability to Various Partnerships\n\nThese rules apply to any corporation (as described above) that is a member of a partnership, even if the partnership has a member that is:\n- An individual, or\n- A professional corporation subject to the 1995 rules limiting deferral for unincorporated businesses\n\n### ASPA Calculation and Designations\n\nThe definition of adjusted stub period accrual in subsection 34.2(1) provides the formulas for calculating a corporation's ASPA in respect of a partnership. The ASPA formula allows the corporation to make two designations:\n\n1. **Qualified Resource Expenses Designation**: Concerns qualified resource expenses incurred by the partnership during the corporation's stub period\n2. **Discretionary Designation**: Allows a corporate partner to reduce its ASPA to reflect its knowledge of the actual partnership income for the stub period\n\n**Important**: Once filed, these designations cannot be amended or revoked. If the discretionary designation amount is too high, creating an income shortfall, the corporation may be subject to an additional income inclusion. This additional inclusion may increase if the shortfall exceeds a 25% threshold.\n\n### Special Rules for New Partners\n\nUnder certain conditions, a corporation (other than a professional corporation) that becomes a member of a partnership in a tax year may make a designation to apportion its income from the partnership between:\n1. The tax year in which the partnership's fiscal period began\n2. The tax year in which the partnership's fiscal period ended\n\n### Required Forms and Schedules\n\nTo calculate the income inclusion under section 34.2 and, if applicable, the income shortfall adjustment and additional amount under section 34.3, use:\n- Schedule 71: Income Inclusion for Corporations that Are Members of Single-Tier Partnerships\n- Schedule 72: Income Inclusion for Corporations that Are Members of Multi-Tier Partnerships\n\nThese are worksheets and do not need to be filed with your return.\n\nTo report the amounts, file a completed:\n- Schedule 73: Income Inclusion Summary for Corporations that Are Members of Partnerships\n\n**Note**: Schedules 1, 6, and 7 are affected by the various rules in section 34.2.\n\n### Implementation Considerations for Tax Applications\n\nWhen implementing ASPA calculations in tax software:\n\n1. Track partnership fiscal periods and corporation tax year alignments\n2. Calculate significant interest thresholds dynamically\n3. Implement the ASPA formula with both designation options\n4. Apply characterization rules based on partnership income composition\n5. Generate appropriate schedules (71, 72, 73) for calculation and reporting\n6. Handle multi-partnership scenarios with separate calculations for each\n7. Validate that designations are within permissible limits\n8. Calculate potential additional income inclusions for excessive designations",
