## Additional Information

Provide all the information requested in the "Additional information" area of your return.

### Line 270 – Did the corporation use the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when it prepared its financial statements?

If the corporation used the IFRS to prepare its financial statements, answer yes to this question.

The IFRS is mandatory for all publicly accountable enterprises. This includes corporations that have calculated their financial statements in accordance with the IFRS but have not complied with all aspects of the IFRS. A corporation that has issued, or is in a process of issuing, publicly-traded debt or equity instruments or who holds assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders is generally considered to be a publicly accountable enterprise.

For the first year when IFRS is adopted, corporations are required to maintain additional documentation to support amounts filed on the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) and tax returns. For more information on IFRS books and records and other IFRS topics, go to canada.ca/international-financial-reporting-standards-ifrs.

### Line 280 – Is the corporation inactive?

Even if a corporation is inactive, which means it has not operated during the tax year, it has to file a return.

**Note:** Corporations that are inactive throughout the tax year and that do not have balance sheet or income statement information to report do not have to attach schedules 100, 125, and 141 to their T2 return. However, they will be accepted if filed.

### Lines 284 to 289 – Specify the principal products mined, manufactured, sold, constructed, or services provided, giving the approximate percentage of the total revenue that each product or service represents

If you file electronically, enter the proper North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code before completing lines 284 to 289. If you do not select the business activity, you will have problems and errors when you prepare the T2 return to be transmitted electronically or printed in bar-code format.

Break down the business activity into the following categories:
- the principal products mined, manufactured, sold, or constructed
- the services provided

Also, give the approximate percentage of the corporation's total revenue that each product or service represents.

### Line 290 – Did the corporation meet the definition of substantive CCPC under subsection 248(1) at any time in the tax year?

#### Substantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using foreign entities

A private corporation that is a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) is subject to refundable Part I tax, such that in certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for a private corporation to cease to be a CCPC. Tax planning strategies have developed that rely on a loss of CCPC status before the realization of investment income.

The concept of substantive CCPC eliminates this potential advantage by taxing passive income earned by a substantive CCPC in the same way as if the corporation was a CCPC.

A substantive CCPC is a private corporation (other than a CCPC) that at any time in a tax year:
- is controlled, directly or indirectly in any way, by one or more Canadian resident individuals, or
- would, if each share of the capital stock of a corporation that is owned by a Canadian resident individual were owned by a particular individual, be controlled by the particular individual

Further, a corporation is considered a substantive CCPC when the corporation would be a CCPC but for the fact that a non-resident or public corporation has a right to acquire its shares.

Measures regarding the deferral of tax using foreign entities generally apply to tax years ending after April 6, 2022, except that the measures apply to tax years starting after April 6, 2022, if both the following apply:
- the corporation's first tax year ending after April 6, 2022, is because of an acquisition of control caused by the sale of all or substantially all of the shares of a corporation to an arm's length purchaser before 2023
- the corresponding written purchase and sale agreement was entered into before April 7, 2022

#### CCPC and substantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using foreign resident corporations

Changes to the foreign accrual property income (FAPI) rules eliminate the tax deferral advantage that was available to CCPCs and their shareholders earning investment income through a controlled foreign affiliate. These measures, which affect both CCPCs and substantive CCPCs, apply to tax years starting after April 6, 2022.

Aside from the two measures above, substantive CCPCs will continue to be treated as non-CCPCs for all other purposes of the Income Tax Act.

### Line 291 – Did the corporation immigrate to Canada during the tax year?

Tick the yes or no box.

### Line 292 – Did the corporation emigrate from Canada during the tax year?

Tick the yes or no box.

### Line 293 – Do you want to be considered as a quarterly instalment remitter, if you are eligible?

A small-CCPC is eligible to make quarterly instalment payments if it meets certain conditions. To determine if you are eligible, see Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation Instalment Guide.

### Line 294 – If the corporation was eligible to remit instalments on a quarterly basis for part of the tax year, provide the date the corporation ceased to be eligible.

Indicate the date that the corporation ceased to be eligible to remit instalments on a quarterly basis.

### Line 295 – If the corporation's major business activity is construction, did you have any subcontractors during the tax year?

Tick the yes or no box.

#### Major business activity

All individuals, partnerships, and corporations whose principal business activity is construction have to report payments made to subcontractors. For these purposes, construction is defined as erecting, installing, altering, modifying, repairing, improving, demolishing, dismantling, or removing any structure or part, including but not limited to buildings, roads, and bridges.

#### Who is a subcontractor?

A subcontractor is an individual, partnership, or corporation that provides construction services.

## Calculating Net Income or Loss

There are several schedules you may have to use to calculate the net income or loss for income tax purposes. This section explains each of those schedules.

### Schedule 1, Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes

Effective January 1, 2024, any deduction from income from non-compliant short-term rentals is disallowed to the extent of the non-compliant amount. On line 295 of Schedule 1, enter the non-deductible amount for non-compliant short-term rentals.

Generally, the net income (loss) reported on your financial statements will not be the same as the net income (loss) required for tax purposes. This is because certain income and expenses reported on your financial statements or the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) may not be used in the calculation of net income (loss) for tax purposes.

For example, you do not deduct charitable donations when determining net income for tax purposes, as you would to arrive at net income on your financial statement.

**Note:** Charitable donations are deducted (afterward) from net income for tax purposes to arrive at taxable income.

Use Schedule 1 to reconcile the net income (loss) reported on your financial statements and the net income (loss) required for tax purposes.

Enter net income or loss after income tax and extraordinary items at amount A, page 1 of Schedule 1. Add the taxable items and the non-allowable expenses listed on lines 101 to 199 and subtract from this the non-taxable items and eligible expenses listed on lines 401 to 499.

Additions and deductions identified on lines 101 to 132 and 401 to 418 of Schedule 1 are the most common additions and subtractions. For other additions and deductions, see pages 3 and 4.

Some expenses deducted on your income statement are not allowable for income tax purposes and are not identified on Schedule 1. In this case, use columns 605 and 295, and line 296, "Other additions", on page 3.

Also, certain items included in income that are not taxable are not identified on this schedule. In such cases, complete columns 705 and 395, and line 396, "Other deductions", on page 4.

**Notes:**
- Only complete lines 203 and 302 if you are converting from an accrual basis to a cash basis. Otherwise, these lines should be left blank.
- The deductible portion of expenses you incurred for food, beverages, and entertainment is only 50% of whichever is less: the expenditure actually incurred or the amount that would be reasonable in the circumstances.
- Eighty percent of expenses for food and beverages consumed by a long-haul truck driver during an eligible travel period are deductible. For more information, see Guide T4002, Self-Employed Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income, or go to canada.ca/taxes-employment-expenses and select "Transportation employees."
- A full deduction is allowed for meals provided to an employee at a temporary construction work camp, if certain conditions are met. For more information on this subject, go to canada.ca/taxable-benefit.
- Taxable capital gains or allowable capital losses allocated by a partnership to a corporate partner are not included on line 129 of Schedule 1 of the corporate partner. Instead, the corporate partner's share of the partnership's capital gain or loss should be reported on Schedule 6 of the corporate partner.

You may have to use the following schedules to calculate certain amounts on Schedule 1:
- Schedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of Capital Property (for details, see below)
- Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) (see page 45)
- Schedule 12, Resource-Related Deductions (see page 64)
- Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves (see page 64)
- Schedule 16, Patronage Dividend Deduction (see page 65)
- Schedule 17, Credit Union Deductions (see page 65)
- Schedule 73, Income Inclusion Summary for Corporations that Are Members of Partnerships (see page 15)
- Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim (see page 65)

### Schedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of Capital Property

You have to complete Schedule 6 if you disposed of capital property during the tax year and incurred any capital losses or realized any capital gains. You also have to complete this schedule if you claim an allowable business investment loss.

#### Designation under paragraph 111(4)(e)

Answer yes or no to the question on line 050, page 1 of Schedule 6.

You can make a designation under paragraph 111(4)(e) if a person or group of persons has acquired control of the corporation. If you make the designation, capital properties will be considered as having been disposed of immediately before that person or group of persons acquired control of the corporation.

#### Completing Schedule 6

To help you complete Schedule 6, the following explanations briefly set out the type of information to enter in each column and each part of the schedule.

**Date of acquisition**
In this column, give the date you acquired the property.

**Proceeds of disposition**
In this column, indicate the proceeds of disposition. The proceeds of disposition are usually the selling price of the property. However, they can also include compensation the corporation received for property that was destroyed, expropriated, stolen, or damaged.

For a gift or a deemed disposition, the proceeds of disposition are usually the fair market value of the property when its owner or use changes.

**References:**
- Section 54
- S3-F3-C1, Replacement Property

**Adjusted cost base**
In this column, indicate the cost of the property you used to calculate any capital gain or loss. This amount is called the adjusted cost base (ACB). The ACB is the original cost of the property that has been adjusted to reflect certain transactions or occurrences that took place after acquiring the property.

The cost of a capital property may be the actual cost, a deemed cost, or the valuation-day value of the property. The nature of the property and the circumstances under which you acquired it determine which cost of the capital property you should use.

**References:**
- Subsections 53(1) and 53(2)

The cost of property acquired after 1971 is usually the actual cost of acquiring it, including the purchase price plus any related costs, such as commissions, legal fees, and other reasonable expenses. It also includes the cost of additions and improvements to the property. It does not include current expenses, such as maintenance and repair costs.

Special rules apply when determining the cost of capital property owned on December 31, 1971. According to these rules, tax is not assessed and losses are not allowed for any gain or loss that arose before that date.

When deductions from the cost base of a property (other than a partnership interest) reduce the balance to a negative amount at any time in the tax year, you are considered to have realized a capital gain equal to the amount of the negative balance, and the ACB becomes nil.

You cannot use later additions to the ACB to reduce previous gains on the property that resulted from a negative balance. You can only consider these additions when you determine future gains or losses.

**Reference:**
- Subsection 40(3)

Paragraphs 53(1)(e) and 53(2)(c) outline the rules for determining the ACB of a partnership interest.

You have to reduce the ACB of a partnership interest by the amount of any share purchase tax credit, and one-half of any scientific research and experimental development tax credit the partnership allocated to the corporation.

**Note:** Interests in a partnership that a limited partner or an inactive partner holds are subject to the negative ACB rule.

**Outlays and expenses**
In this column, enter the amount of outlays and expenses you deducted when calculating a gain or loss. You can deduct most cash outlays the corporation used to put a property into saleable condition when you calculate a gain or loss. You can also deduct expenses incurred when disposing of the property. These expenses include certain fixing-up costs, finder's fees, commissions, surveyor's fees, transfer taxes, and other reasonable expenses incurred to dispose of the property.

**Gain (or loss)**
In the last column, enter the amount of the gain or loss as instructed.

A capital gain results when the proceeds of disposition of a capital property are more than the ACB and any related outlays or expenses. A capital loss occurs when the proceeds of disposition are less than the ACB and the related outlays or expenses. However, if depreciable property is disposed of, it will result in a terminal loss, not a capital loss. See "Column 10 – UCC" (undepreciated capital cost) on page 51 for more details about terminal losses.

In certain cases, when you dispose of a building and the land on which it stands, and the building is disposed of for less than its undepreciated capital cost, you may have to reduce the gain on the sale of the land by the terminal loss on the sale of the building.

**Reference:**
- Subsection 13(21.1)

If you dispose of crypto-assets and other similar properties other than in the course of a business that you operate or an adventure in the nature of trade, the CRA may consider any resulting gain or loss to be a capital gain or capital loss. For more information, go to canada.ca/cra-crypto-assets or see Guide T4037, Capital Gains.

#### Categories of capital property

There are six categories of capital property you may have disposed of during the tax year. The categories are:
- shares
- real estate
- bonds
- other properties
- personal-use property
- listed personal property

The first six parts of Schedule 6 reflect these six categories of capital property.

##### Part 1 – Shares

In this part, list the shares disposed of during the tax year. Give the number of shares, the name of the corporation in which the shares were held, and the class of the shares.

Usually, disposing of a share of the capital stock of a corporation will result in a taxable capital gain or an allowable capital loss. However, if the corporation that is disposing of the share is in the business of trading shares, the resulting gain or loss is considered business income or loss.

If a share is converted because of a merger or an amalgamation, subsection 248(1) deems a disposition to have occurred.

Under paragraph 112(3)(b), a corporation (the shareholder) must reduce the losses from the disposition of shares held as capital property by certain dividends received for those shares. This is called a stop-loss rule. Generally, this rule does not apply when the shareholder owns less than 5% of the shares and has held these shares for over a year.

On line 160, enter the total adjustment for such losses identified in Part 1. Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on disposition of shares at amount A.

**Reference:**
- IT-328, Losses on Shares on Which Dividends Have Been Received

##### Part 2 – Real estate

In this part, list all real estate disposed of during the tax year. Give the municipal address of each property.

Dispositions of non-depreciable real property (unless the property is inventory) may result in a capital gain or loss. However, dispositions of depreciable property may result in a capital gain, a recapture of CCA, or a terminal loss. See "Column 10 – UCC" (undepreciated capital cost) on page 51 for details about terminal losses and recaptures.

Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on disposition of real estate at amount B.

**Reference:**
- IT-218, Profit, Capital Gains and Losses From the Sale of Real Estate, Including Farmland and Inherited Land and Conversion of Real Estate From Capital Property to Inventory and Vice Versa

##### Part 3 – Bonds

In this part, list all bonds disposed of during the tax year. Give the face value, the maturity date, and the issuer's name for each type of bond.

When you make a capital disposition of a debt obligation, the amount of any realized discount or bonus received is usually considered a capital gain. Similarly, a premium paid is considered a capital loss, either when the obligation matures or on the date you dispose of the obligation.

Enter the total amount of gain or loss realized on disposition of bonds at amount C.

**Reference:**
- IT-479, Transactions in Securities

##### Part 4 – Other properties

In this part, describe any capital property disposed of during the tax year that you have not already reported in Parts 1, 2, and 3.

Other property includes capital debts established as bad debts, debts in respect of the disposition of personal-use property established as bad debts, amounts that arise from foreign currency transactions, as well as capital gains or losses allocated from partnerships and trusts.

When an amount receivable on a capital account becomes a bad debt and you elect on your return to have the provisions of subsection 50(1) applied, a deemed disposition occurs at the end of the year. You are considered to have reacquired the debt immediately afterwards at a cost of nil. This usually allows the corporation to claim a bad debt as a capital loss in the year. Any later recovery of that debt will result in a capital gain.

**References:**
- Subsection 50(1)
- IT-159, Capital Debts Established to be Bad Debts

You can deduct, per subsection 50(2), capital losses in respect of bad debts relating to the disposition of personal-use property to a person with whom you deal at arm's length. The amount of the loss cannot be more than the amount of the gain reported on the disposition of the personal-use property.

**Reference:**
- Subsection 50(2)

Foreign exchange gains or losses from buying or selling capital properties are capital gains or capital losses.
