## Investment Tax Credits (ITCs)

### Overview
Investment tax credits provide tax incentives for specific business activities. This section outlines the various ITCs available to corporations, their eligibility requirements, calculation methods, and filing procedures.

### Apprenticeship Expenditure
Apprenticeship expenditure is defined in subsection 127(9) of the Income Tax Act.

### Eligible Child Care Space Expenditure (Expired)
Eligible child care space expenditure was previously defined in subsection 127(9), but this definition has been repealed.

**Important**: You can no longer file a claim for this credit, as it expired on March 31, 2017, and transitional measures expired on December 31, 2019. Only unused credits that have not expired can be carried forward for up to 20 tax years following the tax year in which you made the investment.

## ITC for Qualified Property

### Eligibility
You can earn ITCs on qualified property acquired mainly for use in designated activities in the Atlantic region.

### Designated Activities
Designated activities include, but are not limited to:
- Manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease
- Logging
- Farming or fishing
- Storing grain
- Harvesting peat

**Note**: Eligible machinery and equipment acquired after 2015 and before 2026 for use in Canada mainly for manufacturing and processing goods for sale or lease is included in class 53. These assets qualify as qualified property for the ITC.

### ITC Rate
The ITC rate for qualified property is 10%.

### Special Rules for Leasing Corporations
The following rules apply to corporations that lease qualified properties such as prescribed machinery and equipment or prescribed energy generation and conservation property to lessees who use the property in designated activities:

#### For Corporations with Principal Business of Leasing
For a corporation whose principal business is leasing property, lending money, or purchasing conditional sales contracts, accounts receivable, or other obligations, property acquired for leasing in the ordinary course of business in Canada is considered qualified property.

#### For Manufacturing Corporations
For a corporation whose principal business is manufacturing property that it sells or leases, a property is considered qualified property only if the corporation manufactures it and leases it in the ordinary course of its business in Canada.

#### For Sales or Service Corporations
For a corporation whose principal business is selling or servicing property, a property is considered qualified property only if it is a type of property that the corporation sells or services, and the property is leased in the ordinary course of business in Canada.

## Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) ITC

### Filing Requirements
You must file Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim, along with Schedule 31 when claiming an ITC on qualified expenditures for SR&ED.

**Important**: You must identify qualified SR&ED expenditures on Form T661 and Schedule 31 no later than 12 months after the filing due date for the year the expenditures were incurred (without reference to subsection 78(4)).

### SR&ED Qualified Expenditure Pool
The SR&ED qualified expenditure pool includes:
- Qualified SR&ED current expenditures incurred in the year
- Plus or minus adjustments
- Plus any qualified expenditures transferred to the corporation under an agreement as outlined in subsection 127(13)
- Less any qualified expenditures transferred by the corporation under such an agreement

For agreements under subsection 127(13), use Form T1146, Agreement to Transfer Qualified Expenditures Incurred in Respect of SR&ED Contracts Between Persons Not Dealing at Arm's Length.

### SR&ED Investment Tax Credit Rates

#### General Rate
Corporations may earn a non-refundable ITC of 15% of the SR&ED qualified expenditure pool at the end of the tax year.

#### Enhanced Rate for CCPCs
Some Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations (CCPCs) may earn an enhanced ITC at the rate of 35% on the SR&ED qualified expenditure pool, up to their expenditure limit.

### Expenditure Limit for CCPCs
The expenditure limit is $3 million and is subject to a phase-out based on the taxable capital employed in Canada of the CCPC and its associated corporations for the previous tax year:
- The limit begins to decrease when taxable capital reaches $10 million
- The limit becomes nil at $50 million and higher

**Upcoming Changes**: For tax years beginning on or after December 16, 2024:
- The expenditure limit will increase from $3 million to $4.5 million
- The phase-out thresholds will increase from $10 million and $50 million to $15 million and $75 million, respectively
- CCPCs will have the option to have their annual expenditure limit determined based on gross revenue instead of taxable capital
- The enhanced refundable SR&ED credit will be extended to Canadian public corporations (with different phase-out rules based on gross revenue over the prior three years)

### Refundability of SR&ED ITCs

#### For Qualifying CCPCs
Qualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC are entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate of 40% on their capital expenditures.

#### For Non-Qualifying CCPCs
CCPCs that do not meet the definition of qualifying corporation can earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure limit. This ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the year to offset Part I tax. The ITC earned on SR&ED expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is earned at the rate of 15% and is not refundable.

#### For Qualifying Corporations
CCPCs that meet the definition of qualifying corporation can earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure limit. This ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the year to offset Part I tax. For qualifying corporations, the ITC earned on SR&ED expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is earned at the rate of 15%, of which 40% is also refundable.

### Definition of Qualifying Corporation
A qualifying corporation is a CCPC whose taxable income for the previous tax year (before applying specified future tax consequences) plus the taxable incomes of all associated corporations (before applying specified future tax consequences for tax years ending in the same calendar year) is not more than the total of the qualifying income limits of the corporation and associated corporations for those previous years.

The qualifying income limit is $500,000. It begins to decrease when the total taxable capital employed in Canada of the corporation and its associated corporations for the previous tax year reaches $10 million and becomes nil at $50 million.

### Associated Corporations Rules
If a corporation is associated with one or more CCPCs, you must allocate the expenditure limit among the associated CCPCs on Schedule 49, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Expenditure Limit.

**Special Exception**: Corporations may be associated because the same group of persons controls them, but the members of this group do not act together and have no other connection to each other. CCPCs that are associated only because of this definition of a group will not be considered associated for:
- The refundable ITC on eligible SR&ED expenditures
- Calculating the expenditure limit
- Allocating the expenditure limit

For this exception to apply, one of the corporations must have at least one shareholder who is not common to both corporations.

## Apprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit

### Credit Calculation
A corporation can earn a non-refundable ITC equal to 10% of the eligible salaries and wages paid to eligible apprentices employed in the business in the tax year, to a maximum credit of $2,000 per year per apprentice.

### Eligible Apprentice
An eligible apprentice is one who:
- Is working in a prescribed trade
- Is in the first 24 months of their apprenticeship contract
- Has a contract registered with Canada or a province/territory under an apprenticeship program designed to certify or license individuals in the trade

**Note**: Prescribed trades include those currently listed as Red Seal Trades. For more information, visit red-seal.ca. The Minister of Finance may prescribe additional trades in consultation with the Minister of Employment and Social Development.

### Eligible Salaries and Wages
Eligible salaries and wages are those payable by the employer to an eligible apprentice for employment in Canada during the tax year and within the first 24 months of the apprenticeship.

**Exclusions**: Eligible salaries or wages do not include:
- Qualified expenditures incurred by the corporation in a tax year
- Remuneration based on profits
- Bonuses
- Taxable benefits including stock options
- Certain unpaid remuneration

### Special Rules for Related Employers
When two or more related employers employ an apprentice, special rules apply to ensure that the $2,000 limit is allocated to only one employer.

### Carryforward and Carryback
An unused credit can be carried back 3 years and carried forward 20 years.

### Filing Requirements
Complete parts 19 to 21 of Schedule 31 to calculate the credit.

## Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for Child Care Spaces (Expired)

**Note**: You can no longer earn this credit. It was eliminated for expenditures made after March 21, 2017, as was the transitional measure for eligible expenditures incurred before 2020 under a written agreement entered into before March 22, 2017. You can only carry forward the non-refundable, unused, unexpired credit for 20 tax years.

### Claiming Carryforward
To claim the carryforward, complete parts 22 and 23 of Schedule 31.

### Recapture Rules
The credit will be added to the taxpayer's tax otherwise payable under Part I of the Act if, at any time within 60 months of the day on which the taxpayer acquired the property:
- The new child care space is no longer available, or
- Property that was an eligible expenditure for this credit is sold or leased to another person or converted to another use

For more information on the recapture, see Line 602.

## Investment Tax Credit (ITC) Claim Procedures

### Deduction Against Tax Payable
You can deduct the full amount of ITC against federal Part I tax payable.

#### For Depreciable Property
If you are claiming an ITC for a depreciable property, reduce the capital cost of the property in the next tax year by the amount of this year's ITC. For more information, see Schedule 8, "Column 3 – Cost of acquisitions during the year".

#### For SR&ED ITC
If you are claiming an SR&ED ITC to reduce tax payable or to receive a refund, you must reduce the pool of deductible SR&ED expenditures in the next tax year. For more information, see Line 435 in Guide T4088, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim – Guide to Form T661.

### Restriction on Exempt Income
**Important**: A corporation cannot claim an ITC for an expense or expenditure incurred in the course of earning income if any of that income is exempt income or is exempt from tax under Part I.

### Carryforward and Carryback Rules
You can carry forward certain ITCs not previously deducted for 20 years, or carry them back 3 years, to reduce Part I tax. Remember that you can only carry back ITCs to a prior year if you cannot deduct them in the year you earn them.

**Special Rules**: Special rules restrict the carryforward and carryback of ITCs following an acquisition of control.
