## Summary of Tax and Credits

In the "Summary of tax and credits" area of your T2 return, summarize the amounts of federal and provincial or territorial tax payable, as well as the credits and refunds claimed to reduce total tax payable.

## Federal Tax

### Line 700 – Part I Tax Payable
On line 700, enter the amount of Part I tax payable that you determined at amount N of page 8 of your T2 return.

### Line 705 – Part II.2 Tax Payable
For transactions that occur after 2023, a 2% tax on repurchases of equity applies (subject to certain exceptions) on the net value of all equity repurchases during the year by:

- A corporation resident in Canada (other than a mutual fund corporation) whose shares are listed on a designated stock exchange at any time in the tax year
- A trust whose units are listed on a designated stock exchange at any time in the tax year and that is one of the following:
  - A real estate investment trust
  - A specified investment flow-through (SIFT) trust
- A partnership where the partnership unit is listed on a designated stock exchange at any time in the tax year and that is a SIFT partnership
- Publicly traded entities that would be SIFT trusts or SIFT partnerships if their assets were located in Canada

The tax does not apply to an entity described above in a tax year if the total fair market value of equity that is redeemed, acquired, or cancelled in that tax year (prorated for short tax years) is less than $1 million.

**Note:** This tax is part of Canada's response to the OECD Pillar Two framework and applies to share buybacks by large corporations. Ensure accurate tracking of all equity repurchase transactions throughout the fiscal year to determine eligibility for the $1 million exemption threshold.
