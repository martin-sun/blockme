This return is used to \ncalculate federal income tax and credits. Corporations that \nhave a permanent establishment in any province or \nterritory other than Quebec or Alberta also use this return \nto report provincial and/or territorial income taxes and \ncredits. Corporations with a permanent establishment in \nQuebec or Alberta must file a separate provincial return. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe CRA’s publications and personalized correspondence are \navailable in braille, large print, etext, and MP3. For more \ninformation, go to canada.ca/cra-multiple-formats or \ncall 1-800-959-5525. If you are outside Canada and the United \nStates, call 613-940-8497. The CRA only accepts collect calls made \nthrough a telephone operator. After your call is accepted by an \nautomated response, you may hear a beep and notice a normal \nconnection delay. This service operates in Eastern Standard Time \nand is open Monday to Friday from 8 am to 8 pm and Saturday \nfrom 9 am to 5 pm. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis guide uses plain language to explain the most common tax situations. It is provided for information only and does not \nreplace the law. \nLa version française de ce guide est intitulée Guide T2 – Déclaration de revenus des sociétés. \nUnless otherwise stated, all legislative references are to the Income Tax Act or, where appropriate, the Income Tax Regulations. \nThe Canada Revenue Agency uses the term Indian because it has legal meaning under the Indian Act.\n\n\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \nWhat’s new \n \nFederal, provincial, and territorial \nbudgets for 2024 \nNew items in this guide are outlined in colour. These \ninclude changes introduced in the 2024 federal, provincial, \nor territorial budgets. This guide may contain changes that \nhad not yet become law at the time of publishing. \nCanada carbon rebate for small \nbusinesses \nA new refundable tax credit is available to return a portion \nof fuel charge proceeds collected under the federal carbon \npollution pricing system to eligible Canadian-controlled \nprivate corporations (CCPCs). \nTo be eligible for a Canada carbon rebate for a calendar \nyear, a corporation must: \n■ have had no more than a total of 499 employees in all \nprovinces in Canada in the calendar year \n■ for the 2019 to 2023 calendar years, file a tax return for its \n2023 tax year by July 15, 2024, and \n■ have been a CCPC at all times in the tax year ending \nin 2023 \nThe tax credit amount will be: \n■ the total number of persons the CCPC employed in each \ndesignated province, for each calendar year from 2019 to \n2023, multiplied by \n■ the fuel return the minister of Finance specified for that \ndesignated province for that calendar year \nThe designated provinces are Newfoundland and \nLabrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New \nBrunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. \nCCPCs will not have to apply for this tax credit. Once the \ncorporation files a tax return for a tax year ending in 2023, \nthe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will determine the \ncorporation’s eligibility and, generally, issue the rebate to it. \nFor calendar years after 2023, the Canada carbon rebate will \nbe determined in a similar way – the CRA will \nautomatically calculate the rebate for eligible CCPCs that \nfiled a tax return on or before July 15 of the next calendar \nyear. \nFor the 2024-25 and later fuel charge years: \n■ small businesses that have between 1 and 20 employees \nacross Canada would qualify for a minimum payment \namount as if they had 20 employees \n■ corporations would have their payment amounts \nreduced on a straight-line basis when the number of \nemployees across Canada is between 300 and 500. The \npayment amount would be zero once the number of \nemployees across Canada reaches 500 \n■ the rebate would be newly available to cooperative \ncorporations and credit unions \n■ proceeds will continue to be returned automatically to \neligible corporations through direct deposits and cheques \nfrom the CRA, separately from CRA tax refunds \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency \n/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax \n-credits/canada-carbon-rebate-small-businesses. \nGlobal minimum tax \nA new global minimum tax was introduced to ensure that \nlarge multinational enterprises (MNEs) are subject to a \nminimum effective tax rate of at least 15% on their profits in \neach jurisdiction they operate in. Large MNEs are \nentreprises with more than €750 million in worldwide \nrevenues on a consolidated group basis. \nThe new tax applies to fiscal years starting on or after \nDecember 31, 2023. Corporations that are subject to this tax \nmust file applicable returns separately from their T2 \nCorporation Income Tax Return. \nExempt interest and financing \nexpenses on purpose-built residential \nrentals and regulated energy utility \nbusinesses \nThe definition of “exempt interest and financing expenses” \nin subsection 18.2(1) provides an exemption from the \nexcessive interest and financing limitation (EIFEL) rules for \ninterest and financing expenses (IFE) incurred in respect of \nthe financing of certain Canadian public-private \npartnership infrastructure projects. \nUnder proposed changes, this definition would be \namended by adding two elections: \n■ an election to exempt certain IFE incurred before \nJanuary 1, 2036, in respect of arm’s length financing \nused to: \n– build or acquire an eligible purpose-built residential \nrental \n– convert a property into an eligible purpose-built \nresidential rental in Canada \n■ an election to exempt IFE incurred in respect of an arm’s \nlength borrowing or financing used for the purpose of \ngaining or producing income from a regulated energy \nutility business in Canada \nA purpose-built residential rental would be a building or \npart of a building situated in Canada: \n■ containing either: \n– at least 10 residential rental units (that is, housing units \nused or intended for use as rented residential premises \nand not provided to the travelling or vacationing \npublic) \n– at least 4 residential rental units that are private (a unit \nwith a private kitchen, bathroom, and living area), and\n\n\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n■ in which all or substantially all (90%) of the residential \nrental units would be rented or offered for rent for \ncontinuous periods of no less than 28 consecutive days \nManipulation of bankrupt status \nUnder proposed changes, the exception to the debt \nforgiveness rules for bankrupt corporations and the loss \nrestriction rule applicable to bankrupt corporations will be \nrepealed. \nAs a result, bankrupt corporations would be subject to the \ngeneral rules that apply to other corporations whose \ncommercial debts are forgiven. This change would apply to \nbankruptcy proceedings that started after April 15, 2024. \nReporting rules for digital platform \noperators \nNew reporting requirements have been introduced for \nthe 2024 calendar year for platform operators in select \nsegments of the digital economy under Part XX (which \ncame into force January 1, 2024). Starting in January 2025, \nreporting platform operators have to file an information \nreturn on sellers using their platform to generate revenue in \nselect segments of the platform economy. For more \ninformation, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs \n/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/reporting \n-rules-digital-platforms. \nSynthetic equity arrangement \nA corporation can generally deduct the amount of any \ndividends received on a share of a corporation resident in \nCanada. However, this is subject to certain limitations. One \nof these limitations is an anti-avoidance rule that denies the \ndividend received deduction in respect of synthetic equity \narrangements (SEA). The anti-avoidance rule does not \napply for SEA for which the taxpayer has established that \nno tax-indifferent investor has all or substantially all of the \nrisk of loss and opportunity for gain or profit in respect of \nthe share. \nUnder proposed changes, this anti-avoidance rule would be \nsimplified by removing the tax-indifferent investor \nexception (including the exchange traded exception). \nCorporations would therefore be unable to claim the \ndeduction for dividends received on a share there is a SEA \nfor, without any exceptions. This would apply to dividends \nreceived after December 31, 2024. \nWithholding for non-resident service \nproviders \nCurrently, a person who pays a fee, commission, or other \namount to a non-resident for services provided in Canada \nis required to withhold 15% of the payment and remit it to \nthe CRA. Effective on royal assent, the CRA would be able \nto waive this withholding requirement over a specific \nperiod under certain conditions. See page 11. \nAvoidance of tax debts \nA new supplementary rule was announced to strengthen \nthe existing tax debt anti‑avoidance rule that is intended to \nprevent taxpayers from avoiding their tax liabilities by \ntransferring their assets to non-arm’s length persons for \ninsufficient consideration. \nUnder the new supplementary rule, where certain \nconditions are met, the property transferred by the tax \ndebtor would be deemed to have been transferred to the \ntransferee for the purposes of the tax debt avoidance rule. \nThis would ensure that the tax debt avoidance rule applies \nin situations where property has been transferred from a \ntax debtor to a person and, as part of the same transaction \nor series, property has been received by a non-arm’s length \nperson. \nIn addition, the existing penalty would be extended to tax \ndebt avoidance planning that is subject to the \nsupplementary rule. The penalty is equal to the lesser of: \n■ 50% of the tax that is attempted to be avoided \n■ $100,000 plus any amount the person, or a related person, \nis entitled to receive or obtain regarding the planning \nactivity \nTo further enhance the effectiveness of the tax debt \nanti-avoidance rule, it is proposed that taxpayers who \nparticipate in tax debt avoidance planning would be jointly \nand severally, or solidarily, liable for the full amount of the \navoided tax debt. This amount would include any portion \nthe planner retained as a fee. These measures would apply \nto transactions or series of transactions that occur after \nApril 15, 2024. See page 16. \nReportable and notifiable transactions \npenalty \nThe general penalty provision for failure to file an \ninformation return is removed for reportable or notifiable \ntransactions, as there are specific penalty provisions under \nthe mandatory disclosure rules (MDR) that apply. This is \ndeemed to have come into force on June 22, 2023, which is \nthe coming into force date of the specific penalty provisions \nunder the MDR. See page 19. \nNon-compliance with information \nrequests \nUnder proposed changes, effective on royal assent, the \ninformation gathering provisions would be amended by: \n■ creating a new notice of non-compliance \n■ providing the possibility to require that any required \ninformation or document be provided under oath \n■ adding a penalty when the CRA issues a compliance \norder or a notice of non-compliance \n■ expanding the rules to stop the reassessment limitation \nclock \nSee page 21. \nExcessive interest and financing \nexpenses limitation (EIFEL) rules \nNew EIFEL rules limit the net amount of interest and \nfinancing expenses (interest and financing expenses minus\n\n\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \ninterest and financing revenues) that can be deducted by a \ntaxpayer that is not an excluded entity. For tax years \nstarting on or after January 1, 2024, the limit is generally \nequal to 30% of adjusted taxable income. As a transition \nmeasure, a ratio of 40% applies to tax years starting on or \nafter October 1, 2023, and before January 1, 2024. See \npage 38. \nNon-compliant short-term rentals \nEffective January 1, 2024, any deduction (including capital \ncost allowance deduction in Schedule 8) from income in \nrespect of non-compliant short-term rentals is disallowed to \nthe extent of a non-compliant amount. See page 41. \nAccelerated capital cost allowance \n(CCA) \nUnder proposed changes, an accelerated CCA rate of 10% \nunder class 1 would apply to new eligible purpose-built \nrental housing projects that begin construction after \nApril 15, 2024, and before 2031, and are available for use \nbefore 2036. Investments eligible for this measure would \ncontinue to benefit from the accelerated investment \nincentive (AII), which currently suspends the half-year rule, \nproviding a CCA deduction at the full rate for eligible \nproperty that becomes available for use before 2028. \nImmediate expensing (a 100% first-year deduction) would \napply to new additions of property to CCA classes 44, 46, \nand 50, if the property is acquired after April 15, 2024, and \nbecomes available for use before 2027. Property that \nbecomes available for use in 2027 would continue to benefit \nfrom the AII. \nSee page 46. \nAccelerated investment incentive and \nimmediate expensing \nUnder proposed changes, the accelerated investment \nincentive (AII) and immediate expensing measures for \ncertain CCA classes would be reinstated for qualifying \nproperty acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that \nbecomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year \nphase out after 2029. See pages 46, 47, and 48. \nCharitable donations \nDeadline \nThe deadline for making donations eligible for tax support \nin the 2024 tax year is proposed to be extended until \nFebruary 28, 2025, for tax years ending after \nNovember 14, 2024, and before 2025. See page 70. \nReceipts \nEffective on registration of the amended Regulation, \ncharities will be allowed to issue donation receipts \nelectronically, if: \n■ they contain all required information \n■ they are issued in a secure and non-editable format \n■ the charity maintains an electronic copy of the receipts \nSee page 70. \nLine 580 – Total labour requirements \naddition to tax \nFor clean economy investment tax credits (ITCs) other than \nthe clean technology manufacturing ITC, there are \nconsequences for not complying with the labour \nrequirements if you have attested and elected to meet the \nlabour requirements and claimed the credit at the regular \nrate. See page 83. \nScientific research and experimental \ndevelopment \nThe Government announced that, for tax years that begin \non or after December 16, 2024: \n■ the annual expenditure limit on which CCPCs are \nentitled to earn an enhanced 35% investment tax credit \nwould increase from $3 million to $4.5 million; \n■ the prior-year taxable capital phase-out thresholds for the \nenhanced credit would increase from $10 million and \n$50 million, to $15 million and $75 million, respectively; \n■ the enhanced refundable SR&ED credit would be \nextended to Canadian public corporations \nFor property acquired after December 15, 2024 (or lease \ncosts first becoming payable after that date) the pre-2014 \neligibility of capital expenditures would be reinstated to \nboth the SR&ED income deduction and the SR&ED ITC. \nQualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC would \nbe entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate \nof 40% on their capital expenditures. See page 89. \nMutual fund corporation \nUnder proposed changes, for tax years starting after 2024, a \ncorporation will not qualify as a mutual fund corporation if \nit is controlled by or for the benefit of a corporate group \n(including a corporate group that consists of any \ncombination of corporations, individuals, trusts, and \npartnerships that do not deal with each other at arm’s \nlength). \nThis new rule would not apply to mutual fund corporations \nincorporated within the two previous years and where \nspecified persons hold shares with a value of $5 million or \nless. Exceptions would apply to ensure that the measure \ndoes not adversely affect mutual fund corporations that are \nwidely held pooled investment vehicles. See page 138. \nClean technology ITC \nUnder proposed changes, for businesses investing in \neligible property that is acquired and becomes available for \nuse on or after November 21, 2023, eligibility for the credit \nwould include systems that produce electricity, heat, or \nboth electricity and heat, from eligible waste biomass. See \npage 136.\n\n\n\n=== Page 6 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \nClean hydrogen ITC \nUnder proposed changes, effective for property that is \nacquired and becomes available for use in an eligible \nproject on or after December 16, 2024, the clean hydrogen \nITC would be expanded to include projects that produce \nhydrogen from methane pyrolysis. See page 136. \nClean technology manufacturing ITC – \nPolymetallic extraction and processing \nBecause producing qualifying materials may occur during \npolymetallic projects (projects that produce multiple \nmetals), under proposed changes, several adjustments \nwould be made to the credit. One of these includes \nchanging to a \"primarily\" test (with 50% rather than 90%) \nfor property used in qualifying mineral activities expected \nto produce qualifying materials at mine or well sites. See \npage 137. \nClean electricity investment tax credit \nDetails were provided on the conditions that would need to \nbe satisfied in order for a province or territory to be a \ndesignated jurisdiction, along with annual public reporting \nrequirements that will apply to any provincial and \nterritorial crown corporations claiming the clean \nelectricity ITC. \nCanada Infrastructure Bank \nUnder proposed changes, the Canada Infrastructure Bank \nwould be included as an eligible entity under the clean \nelectricity ITC. Financing provided by the Canada \nInfrastructure Bank to another eligible entity would not \nreduce the capital cost of eligible property for the purpose \nof computing that entity’s clean electricity ITC. These \nmeasures would apply to eligible property that is acquired \nand that becomes available for use on or after \nDecember 16, 2024. \nElectric vehicle supply chain ITC \nThe Government announced a new 10% electric \nvehicle (EV) supply chain investment tax credit. It would \napply on the cost of buildings used in key segments of the \nEV supply chain for businesses that invest in Canada across \nthree supply chain segments: \n■ electric vehicle assembly \n■ electric vehicle battery production \n■ cathode active material production \nA corporation would have to invest at least $100 million in \neach of the three segments. See page 138. \nNewfoundland and Labrador – \nProvincial corporation tax \nEffective January 1, 2024, the lower rate of income tax is \ndecreased from 3% to 2.5%. See page 101. \nNewfoundland and Labrador \ninteractive digital media tax credit \nThe credit, which was set to end December 31, 2024, has \nbeen made permanent. See page 103. \nNova Scotia innovation equity tax \ncredit \nThe credit, which was set to end February 29, 2024, has \nbeen extended five years to March 1, 2029. See page 105. \nNova Scotia venture capital tax credit \nThe credit, which was set to end March 31, 2024, has been \nextended five years to March 30, 2029. See page 105. \nNova Scotia digital media tax credit \nThe credit, which was set to end December 31, 2025, has \nbeen extended five years to December 31, 2030. See \npage 106. \nNova Scotia digital animation tax \ncredit \nThe credit, which was set to end December 31, 2025, has \nbeen extended five years to December 31, 2030. See \npage 106. \nOntario computer animation and \nspecial effects (OCASE) tax credit \nFor film or television productions for which no specified \nlabour costs were incurred before March 26, 2024, an \neligible production no longer has to qualify for either the \nOntario film and television tax credit or the Ontario \nproduction services tax credit to claim the OCASE credit. \nInstead, the corporation has to incur a minimum of $25,000 \nin Ontario labour expenditures for each film or television \nproduction it is claiming the OCASE credit for. See \npage 112. \nManitoba interactive digital media tax \ncredit \nExpenses for eligible projects are to be claimed in the tax \nyear in which they were incurred. The requirement that a \ncorporation claim the credit on or before its filing due date \nfor the tax year is eliminated. Some qualified corporations, \nin certain circumstances, will be exempt from having to \napply for a certificate of eligibility (pre-approval) before \nproject work begins. See page 121. \nManitoba data processing investment \ntax credits \nThese credits are eliminated for the 2025 and later tax years. \nSee page 123.\n\n\n\n=== Page 7 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \nManitoba rental housing construction \nincentive tax credit \nEffective for the 2024 tax year, a new refundable tax credit \nis announced that will provide: \n■ $8,500 for the construction of new market-rate rental \nunits \n■ $13,500 for units classified and maintained as affordable \nunits for a period of at least 10 years \nConstruction must start on or after January 1, 2024. See \npage 124. \nSaskatchewan – Provincial corporation \ntax \nThe lower tax rate of income tax of 1% has been made \npermanent. See page 125. \nBritish Columbia film and television \ntax credit \nAnimated productions that begin key animation on or after \nJune 1, 2024, are no longer eligible for the regional and \ndistant location regional tax credits. See page 128. \nBritish Columbia production services \ntax credit \nAnimated productions that begin key animation on or after \nJune 1, 2024, are no longer eligible for the regional \nproduction services and distant location production \nservices tax credits. See page 130. \nBritish Columbia mining exploration \ntax credit \nEffective February 23, 2024, mining exploration expenses \nrelated to a bituminous sands deposit or oil shale deposit \ndo not qualify for the mining exploration tax credit. See \npage 129. \nBritish Columbia training tax credit \nThe credit, which was set to end December 31, 2024, is \nextended three years to December 31, 2027. See page 131. \nBritish Columbia interactive digital \nmedia tax credit \nEffective September 1, 2024, products that enable gambling \nwith currency will not qualify as interactive digital media \nproducts. See page 132. \nBritish Columbia shipbuilding and ship \nrepair industry tax credit \nThe credit, which was set to end December 31, 2024, is \nextended two years to December 31, 2026.

A new series of technical \npublications, called the income tax folios, is progressively \nreplacing the interpretation bulletins. This process is taking \nplace over several years. To be notified of new or updated \nincome tax folios, subscribe to the electronic mailing list \nat canada.ca/cra-email-lists. \nMany of CRA’s publications, including forms, schedules, \nICs, ITs, and folios are available at canada.ca/cra-forms \n-publications. A table at the end of this guide lists forms by \nnumber. \nAgriStability and AgriInvest programs \nThe CRA is not involved in administering the AgriStability \nand AgriInvest programs for corporations. For more \ninformation on these programs, go to agr.gc.ca/agristability \nand agr.gc.ca/agriinvest. \nCRA’s service pledge \nThe CRA will process 95% of T2 corporation income tax \nreturns filed electronically within 45 days. \nFind out if you have to file a T2 return \nResident corporations \nAll corporations—including non-profit organizations, \ntax-exempt corporations, and inactive corporations—have \nto file a T2 return for every tax year, even if there is no tax \npayable. The only exceptions to this rule are tax-exempt \nCrown corporations, Hutterite colonies, and corporations \nthat were registered charities throughout the year. \nNon-resident corporations \nA non-resident corporation has to file a T2 return if, at any \ntime in the year, one of the following situations applies: \n■ it carried on business in Canada \n■ it had a taxable capital gain \n■ it disposed of taxable Canadian property, unless the \ndisposition meets all the criteria listed below in the \nsection “Dispositions of taxable Canadian property \n(certificates of compliance)” \nThis requirement applies even if the corporation claims that \nany profits or gains realized are exempt from Canadian \nincome tax due to the provisions of a tax treaty. \nBusiness is defined in subsection 248(1) and the extended \nmeaning of carrying on business (in Canada) is defined in \nsection 253. \nThe references to taxable capital gain do not include any \ngain resulting from the disposition of shares that are listed \non a designated stock exchange (other than taxable \nCanadian property). \nA non-resident corporation also has to file a T2 return in a \nnumber of situations, including: \n■ when it has filed Form NR6, Undertaking to File an Income \nTax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real or \nImmovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty, to pay \nPart I tax on the net amount of timber royalty income or \nrental income from real property under subsection 216(4) \nfor the current year and the CRA approved it \n■ when it has filed Form T1288, Application by a \nNon-Resident of Canada (Corporation) for a Reduction in the \nAmount of Non-Resident Tax Required to Be Withheld on \nIncome Earned from Acting in a Film or Video Production, to \npay Part I tax on the net amount of acting services \nunder subsection 216.1(1) for the current year and the \nCRA approved it \nEven if neither of these requirements applies, a \nnon-resident corporation may still want to file a return if \nany of the following situations apply: \n■ when it wants to claim a refund \n■ when it wants to elect to pay Part I tax on the net amount \nof timber royalty income or rental income from real \nproperty under subsection 216(1) for the current year \n■ when it wants to elect to pay Part I tax on the net amount \nof acting services under subsection 216.1(1) for the \ncurrent year \nNote \nNon-resident corporations must file their T2 return, \nschedules, and the General Index of Financial \nInformation in Canadian funds only. They are not \neligible to file in a functional currency per section 261. \nIf you have questions about non-resident returns, go \nto canada.ca/taxes-international-business. \nDispositions of taxable Canadian property (certificates \nof compliance) \nA non-resident corporation that disposes of taxable \nCanadian property must notify the CRA and may be \nrequired to get a certificate of compliance under \nsection 116. For details, see Information Circular IC72-17, \nProcedures Concerning the Disposition of Taxable Canadian \nProperty by Non-residents of Canada – Section 116. \nA non-resident corporation that has a taxable capital gain \nor disposed of taxable Canadian property, including a \ncorporation that may have received a certificate of \ncompliance from the CRA, has to file a return, unless the \ndisposition meets all the following criteria: \n■ no tax is payable under Part I for the tax year \n■ the corporation is not liable to pay any amount under the \nAct for any previous tax year (other than an amount \ncovered by adequate security under section 116 or 220) \n■ each taxable Canadian property disposed of in the tax \nyear is one of the following: \n– excluded property under section 116 \n– property for which a certificate was issued under \nsection 116\n\n\n\n=== Page 11 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n11\nTaxable Canadian property excludes shares of corporations, \nand certain other interests, that, during the 60-month \nperiod ending at the time of determination, do not derive \ntheir value principally from real or immovable property \nsituated in Canada (including Canadian resource property \nand timber resource property). \nNon-resident corporations claiming treaty exemption \nIf you carried on a treaty-protected business in Canada or \ndisposed of a taxable Canadian property that was \ntreaty-protected property during the year (as defined in \nsection 248), you have to complete all of the following lines \non your return: \n■ lines 001 to 082 of page 1 \n■ lines 164, 170, and 171 of page 2 \n■ lines 270 to 289 (except line 271) of page 3 \n■ lines 780 to 990, if applicable, of page 9 \nFor each of the questions asked at lines 164, 170, and 171 \non page 2 of the return to which your response is yes, \ncomplete the appropriate form or schedule and attach it to \nyour return. In addition, you have to complete Schedule 91, \nInformation Concerning Claims for Treaty-Based Exemptions. \nRental income from Canada \nRental income from Canada is subject to a 25% withholding \non the gross rental income under Part XIII, unless the rate is \nreduced by a reciprocal tax treaty. A non-resident \ncorporation can elect to be taxed under Part I on its net \nrental income by filing a T2 return under subsection 216(1) \nwithin two years of the end of the tax year. If the \nnon-resident corporation has filed Form NR6, Undertaking \nto File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent \nfrom Real or Immovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty, \nit must file a T2 return under subsection 216(4) within \nsix months of the tax year end. For more information, see \nIT393R2 – Election Re: Tax on Rents and Timber Royalties \nNon-Residents. \nNote \nIf you file a T2 return under section 216, include only \nrental income. If you have any other income, file a \nsecond T2 return. \nReference \nGuide T4144, Income Tax Guide for Electing Under Section 216 \nServices rendered in Canada (withholding amount) \nA non-resident corporation is subject to a 15% withholding \nunder Regulation 105 on any fee or other amount paid to it \nfor services rendered in Canada (regardless of whether the \nservices are provided by an employee of the corporation or \nare sub-contracted to another party). This withholding is \nheld on account of any potential tax liability that the \ncorporation may have to Canada. The corporation’s tax \nliability is determined when its Canadian income tax return \nis assessed. \nEffective on royal assent, the CRA would be able to waive \nthis withholding requirement over a specified period if \neither of the following conditions were met: \n■ the non-resident is not subject to Canadian income tax \nfor the payments because of a tax treaty between their \ncountry of residence and Canada \n■ the income from providing the services is exempt income \nfrom international shipping or from operating an aircraft \nin international traffic \nThe minister of National Revenue would have the \nlegislative authority to waive the withholding requirement \non multiple transactions with a single waiver, and to \nestablish any conditions and information requirements \nnecessary to reduce compliance risks. \nThe minister could also revoke the waiver if they are no \nlonger satisfied that the conditions are being met. \nA corporation related to a non-resident actor is subject to \na 23% withholding tax under Part XIII on all amounts it \nreceives for the acting services of the actor in a film or video \nproduction in Canada. This withholding tax represents the \nfinal tax liability for these acting services. The corporation \nmay elect not to be taxed under Part XIII at the 23% rate \nby filing a return of income under Part I for the year. A \nnon-resident corporation that has received a reduction \n(filed Form T1288) of this withholding tax from the CRA \nstill has to file a return. \nNote \nSend your Canadian T2 return that you elected to file \nunder section 216.1 to the tax services office that \nprocessed application Form T1288 and issued the \nreduction. Write “Actor’s election” at the top of page 1 of \nthe return. \nReference \nSection 153 \nHow to file your return \nUsing tax preparation software \nOver 90% of corporations file their return electronically. To \ndo so, you must use CRA-certified software. The CRA \ncertifies commercial software to ensure that it meets the \nCRA’s specifications. To find a list of certified software, \nvisit Canada.ca and search for “certified software \ncorporations.” \nA return prepared by certified software can then be \nelectronically filed using: \n■ the CRA’s Corporation Internet Filing service \n■ My Business Account, at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account, if you are a business owner \n■ Represent a Client, at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if \nyou are an authorized representative or employee \nIf you cannot file electronically, you can print the T2 Bar \nCode Return and mail it to the CRA. \nNote \nDo not send the T2 bar code by fax. The CRA does not \naccept it. \nIf you file through an electronic transmitter, you have to \nauthorize the transmitter by completing Form T183 CORP, \nInformation Return for Corporations Filing Electronically, for\n\n\n\n=== Page 12 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n12\neach tax year. As of June 22, 2023, Form T183CORP may be \nsigned with an electronic signature. \nDo not send this form to the CRA, but keep it in case the \nCRA asks for it later. \nT2 Auto-fill \nT2 Auto-fill is a secure service that lets corporations and \nauthorized representatives download information from \nthe CRA to their tax preparation software. Using this \nservice will ensure that certain return and account balances \nwill match CRA’s data. For more information on what \nT2 Auto-fill delivers, go to canada.ca/auto-fill-my \n-t2-return. \nThis service is not mandatory for certified software \nproducts. Some include it and others do not. If you have \nquestions on the availability of the service, contact the \nsoftware product company. \nMandatory electronic filing \nAll corporations with annual gross revenue of more than \n$1 million had to file their T2 return electronically, except \nfor insurance corporations, non-resident corporations, \ncorporations reporting in functional currency, and \ncorporations that are exempt from tax payable under \nsection 149 of the Income Tax Act. \nThis $1 million threshold was eliminated for tax years \nstarting after 2023. Most corporations have to file their \nreturn electronically. \nCorporations that do not file their returns electronically \nwhen required are subject to a penalty. For more \ninformation, see page 16. \nReferences \nSubsection 150.1(2.1) \nRegulation 205.1(2) \nCorporation Internet Filing \nYou must use CRA-approved software that has been \ncertified for Corporation Internet Filing. By filing \nelectronically, you will receive immediate confirmation that \nthe CRA has received your return, enjoy faster processing \nand refunds, save on mailing costs, and help the \nenvironment by using less paper. \nThe T2 Attach-a-doc service allows corporations to attach \nsupporting documentation such as certificates when they \nfile their T2 return or within 24 hours of filing. This service \nis not mandatory for certified software products. Some \ninclude it and others do not. If you have questions on the \navailability of the service, contact the software product \ncompany. \nIf you are filing your T2 return electronically, and you \ncannot use the T2 Attach-a-doc service to file your \nsupporting documents with your return, send them to your \ntax centre (see “Where to file your paper return” on \npage 13). \nWhen sending paper documents, clearly identify your \ncorporation’s name, business number, and the applicable \ntax year-end on the documents. \nIf you are filing an election that does not have a prescribed \nform or prescribed manner, include it with the notes to \nyour financial statements on the General Index of Financial \nInformation (GIFI) to transmit the election electronically \nwith your return, unless otherwise stated on a T2-related \nform. \nFor an up-to-date list of all special elections and returns \nthat can be e-filed using commercial tax preparation \nsoftware, go to canada.ca/cra-special-elections-and \n-returns. \nFor information on your eligibility, available software, \nand more, go to canada.ca/corporation-internet. \nFiling without a web access code \nYou can file corporation returns online without a \nweb access code using “Transmit a return” through: \n■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account, if you are the business owner \n■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if \nyou are an authorized representative or employee \nNorth American Industry Classification System (NAICS) \ncodes \nAll certified tax preparation software for T2 returns uses \nself-identified NAICS codes. \nNAICS codes are hierarchical numerical codes designed to \nprovide common definitions and descriptions of our \nindustries and business activities. NAICS codes are up to \nsix digits long. The Government of Canada as well as the \ngovernments of the provinces and territories use the data \nprovided by NAICS codes for economic analysis and fiscal \npolicy responses. \nThe integration of NAICS codes into T2 commercial tax \npreparation software packages means that corporations \nhave to pick their main revenue-generating business \nactivity directly from a drop-down list or a simple search. \nActive corporations that file their T2 returns either by \nInternet or on paper using 2D bar codes must choose the \nappropriate codes to describe their main \nrevenue-generating business activity. \nCorporations using the return available on Canada.ca do \nnot have to enter a NAICS code. \nAvoid errors \nIt is important that you select the most accurate business \nactivity the first time, since the first year’s code is carried \nforward to following years, allowing for a simple validation \nof the description when there is no change in the main \nbusiness activity. \nIf you do not select the business activity, problems and \nerrors will result when you prepare the T2 return to be \ntransmitted electronically or printed in bar-coded format. \nIf you have any questions on selecting NAICS codes to \ndescribe your corporation’s main revenue-generating \nbusiness activity when filing your T2 return, call the \nBusiness Enquiries line at 1-800-959-5525. \nUsing the returns available on Canada.ca \nElectronic filing of the return results in the quickest \nprocessing time, with 95% of notices of assessment issued\n\n\n\n=== Page 13 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n13\nwithin six weeks. For information on processing times, go \nto canada.ca/cra-processing-times. \nIf you do not have to file electronically, the CRA has \ntwo types of corporation return available for printing. \nT2 Corporation Income Tax Return \nThe T2 Corporation Income Tax Return has nine pages. Any \ncorporation can use it. \nT2 Short Return \nThe T2 Short Return is two pages plus a Schedule 1, Net \nIncome (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes. To complete the \nT2 Short, you may also have to complete a Schedule 8, \nCapital Cost Allowance (CCA) and a Schedule 50, Shareholder \nInformation. The T2 Short Return is a simpler version of the \nT2 Corporation Income Tax Return. Two categories of \ncorporations are eligible to use this return: \n■ You can use this return if the corporation is a \nCanadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) \nthroughout the tax year and this year, it has either a nil \nnet income or a loss for income tax purposes. \n■ You can also use this return if the corporation is exempt \nfrom tax under section 149 (such as a non-profit \norganization). \nIn addition, the corporation must meet all of the following \nconditions to use this return: \n■ it has a permanent establishment in only one province or \nterritory (see page 98) \n■ it is not claiming any refundable tax credits (other than a \nrefund of instalments it paid) \n■ it did not receive or pay out any taxable dividends \n■ it is reporting in Canadian currency \n■ it does not have an Ontario transitional tax debit \n■ it does not have an amount calculated under section 34.2 \nIf the corporation does not fit into either of the above \ncategories or does not meet all of the above conditions, file \na regular T2 return. \nWhen to file your return \nFile your return within six months of the end of each tax \nyear. The tax year of a corporation is its fiscal period. \nWhen the corporation’s tax year ends on the last day of a \nmonth, file the return by the last day of the sixth month \nafter the end of the tax year. \nWhen the last day of the tax year is not the last day of a \nmonth, file the return by the same day of the sixth month \nafter the end of the tax year. \n \nExamples \nTax year-end \nFiling deadline \nMarch 31 \n September 30 \nApril 30 \n October 31 \nJune 30 \n December 31 \nSeptember 23 \n March 23 \nOctober 2 \n April 2 \n \nWhen a filing due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or \npublic holiday recognized by the CRA, your return is \nconsidered on time if the CRA receives it or if it is \npostmarked on or before the next business day. Several \nprovinces and territories have their own unique holidays. \nTherefore, due dates may be affected depending on where \nyou reside. For information on public holidays, go to \ncanada.ca/cra-public-holidays. \nYou must file your return on time. If you do not, the CRA \ncan charge penalties on any return that was not sent by the \nfiling due date. See page 15 for details. \nNote \nYou must file a return no later than three years after \nthe end of a tax year to receive a tax refund. \nRe-appropriation of T2 statute-barred credits \nUnder subsection 221.2(1), the minister of National \nRevenue may use discretion to re-appropriate \nT2 statute-barred credits to an established debt on an \naccount associated with the same business number and \nadministered by the CRA. \nTo request the re-appropriation of a T2 statute-barred \ncredit, send the CRA a completed Form RC431, Request for \nRe-appropriation of T2 Statute-barred Credits, with all the \nsupporting documents. Complete a separate form for each \nunique business number. \nYou can also use the “Enquiries service” in My Business \nAccount at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account. You will \nhave to provide the same details requested on Form RC431 \nin your enquiry. Keep the requested documents in case the \nCRA asks for them later. \nFor more information, see the form or go to canada.ca \n/t2-reappropriation. \nWhere to file your paper return \nThe tax centres in Winnipeg, Sudbury, and Summerside \nprocess corporation tax returns. To find out where to mail \nyour return, go to canada.ca/cra-tso-contact-information or \ncall 1-800-959-5525. \nFilm and media tax credits \nFilm Services Units at the CRA provide services to \ncorporations that may be entitled to receive the Canadian \nfilm or video production tax credit, the film or video \nproduction services tax credit, or other available provincial \nfilm or media tax credits. For more information, including \nthe location and contact number for the Film Services Unit \nserving your area, go to canada.ca/taxes-film. \nWhen and how to pay income tax \nCorporations have to pay income tax in monthly or \nquarterly instalments, unless the total of Part I, Part VI, \nPart VI.1, and Part XIII.1 taxes payable for either the \nprevious year or the current year is $3,000 or less. \nThe balance of tax the corporation owes for a tax year is \ndue within either two or three months of the end of that tax \nyear, depending on the circumstances of the corporation.\n\n\n\n=== Page 14 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n14\nInterest and penalties apply to late payments. To be on \ntime, you have to make instalment payments and other \npayments on or before the due date by using one of the \nseveral methods for making payments: \n■ your Canadian bank or credit union’s online banking, \nmobile app, or telephone service \n■ the CRA’s My Payment service at canada.ca/cra-my \n-payment with your activated debit card from a \nparticipating Canadian bank or credit union with a \nVisa® Debit or Debit Mastercard® logo (does not include \ncredit cards) \n■ pre-authorized debit (PAD) at canada.ca/my-cra \n-business-account which lets you: \n– set up payments to the CRA from a Canadian chequing \naccount on preset dates starting in five or more \nbusiness days \n– pay an amount due, repay overpaid amounts or make \ninstalment payments \n– view your account history and modify, cancel, or skip \na payment \nFor more information on PAD, go to canada.ca/pay \n-authorized-debit. \n■ the “Proceed to pay” button in the “View and pay \naccount balance” page and other pages within My \nBusiness Account \n■ your credit card, Interac e transfer or PayPal through one \nof the third-party service providers for a fee \n■ in person at a Canadian bank or credit union or, for a fee, \nat Canada Post. To do so, you have to use a remittance \nvoucher, which you can request online in \nMy Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account \nNote \nRemittance vouchers have a Quick Response (QR) code \nprinted on them that contains all the information you \nneed to pay with cash or debit at a Canada Post retail \noutlet. \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/payments or contact \nyour financial institution. \nThe CRA considers the payment to be made on the day the \nCRA receives it, and not on the day you send it. \nWhen a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public \nholiday recognized by the CRA, for calculating instalment \ninterest and penalty, your payment is considered on time if \nthe CRA receives it on or before the next business day. \nSeveral provinces and territories have their own unique \nholidays. Therefore, due dates may be affected depending \non where you reside. For information on public holidays, \ngo to canada.ca/cra-public-holidays. \nNote \nSometimes, penalties and interest on late payments can \nbe cancelled or waived. For more information, see \n“Cancel or waive penalties and interest” on page 17. \nInstalment due dates \nInstalment payments for Parts I, VI, VI.1, and XIII.1 taxes \nare due on the last day of every complete month of a \ncorporation’s tax year. The first payment is due one month \nminus a day from the starting date of the corporation’s tax \nyear. The rest of the payments are due on the same day of \neach month that follows. \nEligible small-CCPCs can make quarterly instalment \npayments, instead of monthly ones. For more information, \nsee Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation Instalment Guide. \nYou can view your instalment due dates by using the \n“Calculate and pay instalment payments” service through: \n■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account, if you are the business owner \n■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if \nyou are an authorized representative or employee \nBalance-due day \nGenerally, all corporation taxes (with the exception of \nPart III and Part XII.6) are due two months after the end of \nthe tax year. However, the tax is due three months after the \nend of the tax year if the following conditions apply: \n■ the corporation is a CCPC throughout the tax year; \n■ the corporation is claiming the small business deduction \nfor the tax year, or was allowed the small business \ndeduction in the previous tax year; and either of the \nfollowing applies: \n– the corporation’s taxable income for the previous tax \nyear does not exceed its business limit for that tax year \n(if the corporation is not associated with any other \ncorporation during the tax year) \n– the total of the taxable incomes of all the associated \ncorporations for their last tax year ending in the \nprevious calendar year does not exceed the total of \ntheir business limits for those tax years (if the \ncorporation is associated with any other corporation \nduring the tax year) \nThe business limit is provided at “Line 410 – Business \nlimit” on page 77. For more information about allocating \nthe business limit among associated corporations, see \n“Schedule 23” on page 33. \nNote \nFor determining balance-due days, the taxable income \nfor the previous year of corporations and associated, \nsubsidiary, and predecessor corporations means taxable \nincome before applying loss carrybacks. \nSpecial rules apply to determine the balance-due day of a \nnew corporation formed after an amalgamation or of a \nparent corporation after it receives the assets of a subsidiary \ncorporation that is winding-up. For more information, go \nto canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses \n/topics/corporations/corporation-payments/paying-your \n-balance-corporation-tax or see Guide T7B–Corp, \nCorporation Instalment Guide. \nReference \nSections 125 and 157\n\n\n\n=== Page 15 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n15\nPartnerships – Limiting deferral of \ncorporation tax \nUnder section 34.2, a corporation may have to accrue \nadditional income in respect of a partnership (other than \ndividends for which a deduction is available under \nsection 112 or 113), when the fiscal period of the \npartnership begins in the corporation’s tax year and ends in \na following tax year. The corporation is then required to \naccrue income under the adjusted stub period accrual \n(ASPA) regime for the portion of the partnership’s fiscal \nperiod that falls in the corporation’s tax year (the stub \nperiod). These rules do not affect a corporation’s capital \ndividend account which is to be determined without \nreference to section 34.2. \nSince the ASPA income inclusion in a tax year is an \nestimate of the stub period income, the corporation is \nentitled to claim that same amount in the immediately \nfollowing tax year. Both the ASPA income inclusion and \nthe treatment of that same amount in the following year are \nsubject to the characterization rules under \nsubsection 34.2(5). They are deemed to have the same \ncharacter and be in the same proportions as the partnership \nincome that they relate to. As such, the claim in the \nimmediately following tax year may be a deduction or a \ndeemed allowable capital loss, whichever applies. A \ncorporation may have ASPA in respect of more than one \npartnership and, in such cases, the ASPA rules apply to the \ncorporation on a partnership-by-partnership basis. \nIn general, a corporation (other than a professional \ncorporation) has to include in its income for a tax year its \nASPA for a partnership if all of the following apply: \n■ the corporation has a significant interest in the \npartnership at the end of the last fiscal period of the \npartnership that ends in the tax year \n■ another fiscal period of the partnership begins in the tax \nyear and ends after the tax year of the corporation \n■ at the end of the tax year, the corporation is entitled to a \nshare of an income, loss, taxable capital gain, or \nallowable capital loss of the partnership for the fiscal \nperiod referred to in the preceding bullet \nA corporation has a significant interest in a partnership if \nthe corporation, or the corporation together with affiliated \nor related parties, is entitled to more than 10% of the \npartnership’s income or loss (or assets, net of liabilities, if \nthe partnership were to cease to exist). \nThese rules apply to any corporation (described above), \nthat is a member of a partnership, even if the partnership \nhas a member that is an individual or a professional \ncorporation that is subject to the 1995 rules limiting deferral \nfor unincorporated businesses. \nThe definition of adjusted stub period accrual in \nsubsection 34.2(1) gives the formulas for calculating a \ncorporation’s ASPA in respect of a partnership. The ASPA \nformula allows the corporation to designate two reductions. \nThe first designation concerns qualified resource expenses \nincurred by the partnership during the corporation’s stub \nperiod. The second allows a corporate partner to make a \ndiscretionary designation to reduce its ASPA to reflect its \nknowledge of the actual partnership income for the stub \nperiod. Once filed, the designations cannot be amended or \nrevoked. If the amount of the discretionary designation is \ntoo high, creating an income shortfall, the corporation may \nbe subject to an additional income inclusion. The additional \nincome inclusion may increase if the shortfall is above \na 25% threshold. \nUnder certain conditions, a corporation (other than a \nprofessional corporation) that becomes a member of a \npartnership in a tax year may make a designation to \napportion its income from the partnership between two tax \nyears: \n■ the tax year in which the fiscal period of the partnership \nbegan \n■ the tax year in which the fiscal period of the partnership \nends \nTo calculate the income inclusion under section 34.2 and, if \napplicable, the income shortfall adjustment and additional \namount under section 34.3, use Schedule 71, Income \nInclusion for Corporations that Are Members of Single-Tier \nPartnerships, or Schedule 72, Income Inclusion for Corporations \nthat Are Members of Multi-Tier Partnerships. These are \nworksheets and you do not have to file them with your \nreturn. To report the amounts, file a completed Schedule 73, \nIncome Inclusion Summary for Corporations that Are Members \nof Partnerships, with your return. \nNote \nSchedules 1, 6, and 7 are affected by the various rules in \nsection 34.2 and the amounts reported on Schedule 73 \n(as applicable). For example, the amount entered on \nline 275 of Schedule 73 reporting the total taxable capital \ngains under section 34.2 must also be entered on \nSchedule 6. \nReferences \nSections 34.2, 34.3, and 249.1 \nPenalties \nIf you file your return late \nIf you file your return late, a penalty applies. The penalty \nis 5% of the unpaid tax that is due on the filing deadline, \nplus 1% of this unpaid tax for each complete month that \nthe return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months. \nThe corporation will be charged an even larger penalty if \nthe CRA issued a demand to file the return under \nsubsection 150(2) and if it assessed a failure to file penalty \nfor the corporation in any of the three previous tax years. \nThe penalty is 10% of the unpaid tax when the return was \ndue, plus 2% of this unpaid tax for each complete month \nthat the return is late, up to a maximum of 20 months. \nReferences \nSubsections 162(1) and 162(2) \nNon-resident corporations \nA non-resident corporation will be subject to a failure to file \npenalty equal to the greater of: \n■ the amount calculated under subsections 162(1) or (2), as \ndiscussed above, and \n■ an amount equal to the greater of:\n\n\n\n=== Page 16 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n16\n– $100 \n– $25 for each complete day that the return is late, up to \na maximum of 100 days \nReference \nSubsection 162(2.1) \nLarge corporations \nA large corporation has to file the T2 Corporation Income Tax \nReturn and, if applicable, a Schedule 38, Part VI Tax on \nCapital of Financial Institutions. If a corporation fails to file \nthese returns, in addition to any other penalty as applicable, \nthe CRA will charge a penalty for each complete month that \nthe returns are late, up to a maximum of 40 months. The \npenalty will be the sum of the following amounts: \n■ 0.0005% of the corporation’s taxable capital employed in \nCanada (within the meaning assigned in Part I.3) at the \nend of tax year \n■ 0.25% of the Part VI tax payable by the corporation \n[before the deductions in subsection 190.1(3)] \nTo identify the corporation as a large corporation, answer \nyes to the question at line 233 on page 2 of the return. \nNotes \nA corporation is a large corporation if the total taxable \ncapital employed in Canada at the end of the tax year by \nit and its related corporations is over $10 million. \nTo determine if the total taxable capital employed in \nCanada of the corporation and its related corporations is \ngreater than $10 million use whichever one of the \nfollowing schedules that applies: \n– Schedule 33, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large \nCorporations \n– Schedule 34, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – \nFinancial Institutions \n– Schedule 35, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large \nInsurance Corporations \nA corporation with a permanent establishment in \nNewfoundland and Labrador that is a financial \ninstitution, as defined under provincial legislation, has \nto file Schedule 305, Newfoundland and Labrador \nCapital Tax on Financial Institutions.

See page 106. \nIf schedules 305 or 352 are not filed, the corporation will \nbe liable to a penalty similar to the one for failure to file \nSchedule 38 (described above), in addition to any other \npenalty. \nReference \nSection 235 \nIf you do not comply with mandatory \nelectronic filing \nThe CRA will charge a $1,000 penalty for non-compliance if \na corporation that is required to file electronically does not \ncomply with the requirement. \nReference \nSubsection 162(7.2) \nIf you do not report income \nThe CRA will charge a penalty if a corporation does not \nreport an amount equal to or greater than $500 that is \nrequired to be included in computing its income on its \nreturn in a tax year and any of the three previous tax years. \nThis penalty will not be applied if the corporation is liable \nunder subsection 163(2) for the same unreported amount. \nThe repeated failure to report income penalty is equal to the \nlesser of: \n■ 10% of the amount you did not report on your return for \nthe tax year \n■ 50% of the difference between the understated tax \npayable (and certain overstated refundable tax credits) \nrelated to the amount you did not report and the amount \nof tax withheld related to the amount you did not report \nReferences \nSubsections 163(1) and 163(1.1) \nFalse statements or omissions \nThe CRA will charge a penalty if a corporation, either \nknowingly or under circumstances of gross negligence, \nmakes a false statement or omission on a return. The \npenalty is the greater of either $100 or 50% of the amount of \nunderstated tax. \nReference \nSubsection 163(2) \nNote \nIf a corporation is charged a penalty for making a false \nstatement or omission under subsection 163(2), the \ncorporation cannot be charged a penalty on the same \namount for failing to report income under \nsubsection 163(1). \nMisrepresentation in tax matters by a \nthird party \nThe CRA will charge a penalty if a person advises or helps \nanother person to file a false return or knowingly allows a \ntaxpayer to submit false tax information. \nReferences \nIC01-1, Third-Party Civil Penalties \nSection 163.2 \nAvoidance of tax debts \nUnder proposed changes, a new supplementary rule will be \nintroduced to strengthen the existing tax debt \nanti-avoidance rule. Under the supplementary rule, where \ncertain conditions are met, the property transferred by the \ntax debtor would be deemed to have been transferred to the \ntransferee for the purposes of the tax debt avoidance rule. \nThis would ensure that the tax debt avoidance rule applies\n\n\n\n=== Page 17 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n17\nin situations where property has been transferred from a \ntax debtor to a person and, as part of the same transaction \nor series, property has been received by a non-arm’s length \nperson. \nAdditionally, under proposed changes, taxpayers who \nparticipate in tax debt avoidance planning would be jointly \nand severally, or solidarily, liable for the full amount of the \navoided tax debt. That amount would include any portion \nthe planner has effectively retained. This would apply to \ntransactions or series of transactions that occur after \nApril 15, 2024. \nThe existing penalty for those who engage in, participate in, \nassent to, or acquiesce in planning activity that they know, \nor would reasonably be expected to know, is tax debt \navoidance planning would be extended to apply to tax debt \navoidance planning that is subject to this supplementary \nrule.

For example, your request made in 2024 must \nrelate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending \nin 2014 or later. \nFor interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal \nperiod, the CRA will consider only the amounts that \naccrued during the 10 calendar years before the year in \nwhich you make your request.

This has to be \ndone before the CRA starts any enforcement action or \ninvestigation against you. \nApplications are processed under one of the two programs: \nthe limited program and the general program. \nThe limited program limits the level of relief for \ncorporations who intentionally avoided their tax \nobligations. Under this program, corporations will not be\n\n\n\n=== Page 18 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n18\nreferred for criminal prosecution or charged gross \nnegligence penalties. However, they will be charged other \npenalties and interest as applicable. \nThe general program provides relief to corporations that \nwant to correct unintentional errors. Under this program \ncorporations will not be charged penalties and will not be \nreferred for criminal prosecution related to the information \nbeing disclosed. The CRA will provide partial interest relief \nfor the years preceding the three most recent years of \nreturns required to be filed. \nFor more details on the VDP, get the most recent version of \nInformation Circular IC00-1, Voluntary Disclosures Program, \nor go to canada.ca/taxes-voluntary-disclosures. \nIf you want, you can discuss your situation first on a \nno-name or hypothetical basis.

This \npre-disclosure discussion does not constitute acceptance \ninto the VDP anymore. \nThe process of making disclosures on a no-name basis has \nended. \nInformation reporting of tax avoidance \ntransactions \nTaxpayers, advisors, and promoters who engage in or who \nare entitled to certain fees in relation to certain tax \navoidance transactions are subject to reporting \nrequirements. \nNote \nUnder provincial legislation, Ontario and British \nColumbia corporations must meet the same \nrequirements. \nSeveral new measures affecting the mandatory disclosure \nrules apply after June 21, 2023. \nThe definition of avoidance transaction is amended so that \na transaction is considered an avoidance transaction if it can \nreasonably be concluded that one of the main purposes of \nentering into the transaction is to get a tax benefit. \nThe following changes apply to the mandatory disclosure \nrules: \n■ changes to existing reportable transaction rules \n■ a new requirement to report notifiable transactions \n■ a new requirement to report reportable uncertain tax \ntreatments \n■ related penalties and an extension of the normal \nassessment period in certain circumstances, in the case of \na failure to report \nReportable transactions \nEffective for transactions entered into after June 21, 2023, a \ntransaction is reportable if it is an avoidance transaction as \ndefined in subsection 237.3(1) (previously 245(3)) of the \nfederal Act and has one (previously two) of the following \nthree generic hallmarks: \n■ the advisor or promoter (including any non arm’s length \nparties) has or had an entitlement to certain types of fees \n■ the advisor or promoter (including any non arm’s length \nparties) has or had confidential protection in respect of a \ntax treatment related to the avoidance transaction \n■ the taxpayer, advisor, or promoter (including any non-\narm’s length parties) has or had contractual protection \nfor the transaction (other than as a result of certain types \nof fees or, for transactions entered into after 2022, \nbecause it concerns contractual protection offered in the \ncontext of normal commercial transactions to a wide \nmarket) \nA reportable transaction does not include a transaction that \nis, or is part of, a series of transactions that includes the \nacquisition of a tax shelter or issuance of a flow-through \nshare for which an information return has been filed with \nthe minister of National Revenue under subsection 237.1(7) \nor 66(12.68), respectively. This is the case unless it is \nreasonable to conclude that one of the main reasons for the \nacquisition of a tax shelter, or the issuance of a \nflow-through share, was to avoid the reportable \ntransactions provisions under subsection 237.3. \nFor more information on examples of activities that would \nnot meet a hallmark and therefore not have to meet a \nreporting obligation, go to canada.ca/mandatory \n-disclosure-rules#toc6. \nNotifiable transactions and reportable \nuncertain tax treatments \nNew requirements have been enacted: \n■ to report notifiable transactions. The minister of \nNational Revenue has the authority to designate, with \nthe agreement of the minister of Finance, a transaction or \na series of transactions as a notifiable transaction. \nReporting requirements (and exception to the rule) \nsimilar to those for reportable transactions apply with the \ninclusion of a prescribed form. A notifiable transaction is \na transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar \nto, a designated transaction, or a transaction in a series of \ntransactions that is the same as, or substantially similar \nto, a designated series of transactions. This applies to \nnotifiable transactions entered into after June 21, 2023. \nFor a list of notifiable transactions designated by the \nminister of National Revenue, go to canada.ca \n/notifiable-transactions. You can subscribe to CRA’s \nelectronic mailing list at canada.ca/cra-email-lists to \nreceive an email when new notifiable transactions are \ndesignated by the minister \n■ for a specified corporation to report reportable uncertain \ntax treatments (as reflected in relevant financial \nstatements) with the T2 return for the tax year, where \ncertain conditions are met, including having at least \n$50 million in assets at the end of the financial year that \ncoincides with the tax year. A reportable uncertain tax \ntreatment is a tax treatment that a corporation uses or \nplans to use in its income tax filings (including, for \ngreater certainty, the decision not to include a particular \namount in a return of income) and for which there is \nuncertainty over whether the tax treatment will be \naccepted as being in accordance with tax law. This \napplies to tax years that begin after 2022, but the penalty\n\n\n\n=== Page 19 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n19\nunder subsection 237.5(5) does not apply to tax years that \nbegin before June 22, 2023 \nFiling requirements \nForm RC312 \nFor reportable transactions and notifiable transactions \nentered into after June 21, 2023, you must file Form RC312, \nReportable Transaction and Notifiable Transaction Information \nReturn, within 90 days of the earlier of the day the \ncorporation, or a person transacting for it: \n■ becomes contractually obligated to enter into the \nreportable or notifiable transaction \n■ enters into the reportable or notifiable transaction \nThe previous version of Form RC312, Reportable Transaction \nInformation Return, had to be filed on or before June 30 of \nthe calendar year following the calendar year in which the \ntransaction first became a reportable transaction for the \nperson. That version of the form applies to transactions \nentered into before June 22, 2023. \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/mandatory \n-disclosure-rules. \nForm RC3133 \nFor tax years that start after 2022, if you have one or more \nreportable uncertain tax treatments for a tax year, you must \nfile Form RC3133, Reportable Uncertain Tax Treatments \nInformation Return, for each reportable uncertain tax \ntreatment, on or before the corporation’s tax return filing-\ndue date for the year. \nReassessment \nIf the information return is not filed as required, the \nreassessment period is extended by three years (if the \ncorporation is a CCPC) or four years (if the corporation is \nnot a CCPC) after the day on which the information return \nis filed as required. The scope of an assessment, \nreassessment, or additional assessment during the extended \nreassessment period for a taxpayer’s tax year is limited to \nthe extent that it can reasonably be regarded as relating to \nthe reportable transaction, notifiable transaction, or \nreportable uncertain tax treatment. \nIf a corporation has a reporting requirement for a \ntransaction relevant to the corporation’s income tax return \nfor a tax year, the normal reassessment period will not start \nfor the transaction until the corporation has complied with \nthe reporting requirement. As a result, if a corporation does \nnot comply with a mandatory disclosure reporting \nrequirement for a tax year for a transaction, a reassessment \nof the year will not become statute-barred for the \ntransaction only. \nPenalties \nSince there are specific penalty provisions under the \nmandatory disclosure rules (MDR) that apply to reportable \nor notifiable transactions, the general penalty provision for \nfailure to file an information return is removed for these \ntransactions. This is deemed to have come into force on \nJune 22, 2023, which is the coming into force date of the \nspecific penalty provisions under the MDR. \nFailure to report could result in suspension of the tax \nbenefit, a penalty for failure to report, or both. \nFor transactions entered into after June 21, 2023, penalties \nwill apply for each failure to report a reportable transaction \nor a notifiable transaction: \n■ to persons who enter into such transactions, or for whom \na tax benefit results from such transactions. The penalty \nis equal to: \n– $500 per week for each failure to report the transaction, \nup to the greater of $25,000 and 25% of the tax benefit \n– for a corporation with assets having a total carrying \nvalue of $50 million or more for its last tax year that \nends before the day on which the information return is \nrequired to be filed, $2,000 per week for each failure to \nreport the transaction, up to the greater of $100,000 and \n25% of the tax benefit \n■ to advisors and promoters of such transactions and \npersons who do not deal at arm’s length with them and \nwho are entitled to a fee for the transactions. The penalty \nis equal to the total of: \n– the amount of the fees charged by that person for the \ntransaction \n– $10,000 \n– $1,000 per day that the person fails to report the \ntransaction, up to a maximum of $100,000 \nIn addition, a penalty will apply for each failure to report \nan uncertain tax treatment. The penalty is equal to $ 2,000 \nfor each week (or each part of a week) during which the \nfailure continues, up to a maximum of $100,000. This \npenalty applies to tax years starting after June 21, 2023. \nFile the return separately from your tax return. Before you \nfile it, make a copy for your records.

These time limits vary, depending on the type of \ncorporation and the nature of the reassessment. \nNormal reassessment period \nThe CRA can usually reassess a return for a tax year: \n■ within three years of the date it sent the original notice of \nassessment for the tax year, if the corporation was a \nCCPC at the end of the year \n■ within four years of the date it sent the original notice of \nassessment for the tax year, if the corporation was not a \nCCPC at the end of the year \nExtended reassessment period \nThe normal reassessment period can be extended for an \nextra three years for several reasons, including any of the \nfollowing: \n■ to carry back a loss or credit from a later tax year \n■ when a non-arm’s length transaction (transaction as \ndefined in subsection 247(1)) involving the corporation \nand a non-resident affects the corporation’s tax \n■ if the corporation pays an amount or receives a refund of \nforeign income or profits tax \n■ when a reassessment of another taxpayer’s tax for any of \nthe above reasons affects the corporation’s tax \n■ if the reassessment results from a non-resident \ncorporation’s allocation of revenue or expenses to its \nCanadian business or from a notional transaction, such as \n“branch advance”, between the non-resident corporation \nand its Canadian business \n■ to give effect to the application of the non-resident trust \nrules in section 94 or to the application of the foreign \ninvestment rules under sections 94.1 and 94.2 \n■ if the income is related to a foreign affiliate of the \ncorporation (for tax years of the corporation starting after \nFebruary 26, 2018) \n■ the reassessment is to carry back losses or certain tax \ncredits and deductions where a prescribed form \nrequesting the amendment has been filed on time \nNon-resident non-arm’s length person (extra six years) \nFor losses incurred in a particular tax year, the \nreassessment period for a preceding tax year to which those \nlosses are carried back is extended six years beyond the \nnormal reassessment period if both of the following apply: \n■ the losses are reduced as a result of a reassessment made \nto the particular tax year beyond the normal \nreassessment period for the year \n■ the reassessment to the particular tax year is made as a \nconsequence of a transaction involving the corporation \nand a non-arm’s length non-resident person \nProvincial income reallocation (extra one year) \nIf the reassessment results from a provincial income \nreallocation, the normal reassessment period can be \nextended for one year from the later of: \n■ the day on which the CRA is advised of the provincial \nreassessment\n\n\n\n=== Page 21 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n21\n■ 90 days after the notice of the provincial reassessment \nwas mailed \nSubstantive CCPCs – Deferring tax using foreign \nentities (extra one year) \nThe reassessment period for substantive CCPCs is extended \none year beyond the normal reassessment period for any \nresulting assessment of Part IV tax because of a corporation \nbeing assessed or reassessed a dividend refund. This \nmeasure generally applies to tax years that end after \nApril 6, 2022, with some exceptions. \nRequirements for information and compliance orders \nUnder proposed changes, effective on royal assent, the \nexisting information gathering provisions would be \namended by: \n■ creating a new notice of non-compliance \n■ providing the possibility to require that any required \ninformation or document be provided under oath or \naffirmation \n■ adding a penalty when the CRA issues a compliance \norder or a notice of non-compliance \n■ expanding the rules to stop the reassessment limitation \nclock \nIf the CRA issues a new notice of non-compliance to a \ncorporation that has not complied with a notice or \nrequirement to provide information or assistance, the \npenalty would be equal to $50 for each day the notice of \nnon-compliance is outstanding, up to a maximum of \n$25,000. \nIf the CRA obtains a compliance order from a court to order \na non-compliant taxpayer to comply with a CRA \ninformation request, the new penalty would be equal to \n10% of the aggregate tax payable for the tax years the \ncompliance order relates to, if the tax payable in each \nrelevant tax year is equal or more than $50,000. \nWhen a corporation contests a requirement for information \nor an application for a compliance order in court, a \n“stop-the-clock” rule applies. This rule extends the \ncorporation’s reassessment period by the period of time \nduring which the requirement for information or \ncompliance order is contested. The period generally starts \nwhen the corporation makes its first court filing to contest \nthe requirement for information or compliance order and \nends on the final disposition of the application (including \nany appeals). \nThe “stop-the-clock” rules do not currently apply to all \nsituations when a corporation does not comply with a \nrequirement or notice to provide information that the CRA \nissued. Under proposed changes, effective on royal assent, \nthese rules would be amended so that they apply: \n■ when a corporation seeks a judicial review of any \nrequirement or notice to provide information issued to \nthe corporation or to a person that does not deal at arm’s \nlength with the corporation in relation to the audit and \nenforcement process \n■ during any period a notice of non-compliance is \noutstanding \nNote \nThe CRA can send requirements for information, \nincluding those for foreign-based information, to banks \nand credit unions electronically, rather than delivering \nthem in person or by registered or certified mail. Written \nconsent of the bank or credit union is required before \nrequirements can be sent electronically. \nUnlimited reassessment period \nThe CRA can reassess a return at any time, including when: \n■ the corporation has made a misrepresentation because of \nneglect, carelessness, wilful default, or fraud in either \nfiling the return or supplying information required by \nthe Act \n■ the corporation filed Form T2029, Waiver in Respect of the \nNormal Reassessment Period or Extended Reassessment \nPeriod, with a tax services office before the normal \nreassessment period expires. Form T2029 can be filed up \nto three more years after the end of the normal \nreassessment period if the waiver applies to one of the \nsituations previously described under “Extended \nreassessment period” \nNote \nIf you want to revoke a waiver that was previously filed \nto extend the normal reassessment period for a certain \ntax year, file Form T652, Notice of Revocation of Waiver, at \nyour tax services office. The revocation will take effect \nsix months after you file Form T652. \nSale or disposition of real estate \n The CRA may at any time make an assessment, \nreassessment, or additional assessment of an income tax \nreturn beyond the normal reassessment period for any of \nthe following reasons: \n■ the corporation does not report in its initial income tax \nreturn a sale or other disposition of a real or immovable \nproperty that is capital property of the corporation \n■ the partnership of which the corporation is a member did \nnot report the sale or other disposition in the initial \npartnership information return \nIf the corporation later amends its return to report the \ndisposition of the property (for example by filing a request \nfor adjustments under subsection 245(6)), the CRA may still \nmake a reassessment outside of the normal reassessment \nperiod within three years of the amendment being filed. \nUnder this extended reassessment period, the reassessment \nis limited to amounts reasonably relating to the unreported \nor previously unreported disposition of real or immovable \nproperty that is capital property of the corporation or \npartnership, as the case may be. \nReferences \nSubsections 152(3.1), 152(4), 152(4.01), and 152(4.1) \nIC75-7, Reassessment of a Return of Income \nHow to request a reassessment \nYou can request a reassessment electronically using the \nlatest commercial tax preparation software packages, or \nsend a letter to the tax centre that serves the corporation. If \nyou send a letter, state the name of the corporation, the\n\n\n\n=== Page 22 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n22\nbusiness number, the tax year, and any details that apply. \nWith your letter, include any relevant supporting \ninformation, such as revised financial statements or the \nGeneral Index of Financial Information (GIFI) and \nschedules. If you are preparing your return using tax \npreparation software, submit the bar codes that contain the \ninformation needed to reassess your return. Do not send \nthe entire T2 return. \nTo ask to carry back a loss or tax credit to a prior tax year, \nfile whichever of the following schedules apply: \n■ Schedule 4, Corporation Loss Continuity and Application, \nto ask to carry back a loss \n■ Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign \nIncome Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to ask \nto carry back foreign tax credits on business income \n■ Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, to ask \nto carry back an investment tax credit \n■ Schedule 42, Calculation of Unused Part I Tax Credit, to ask \nto carry back a Part I tax credit \nYou can file these schedules with the return on which you \nreport the loss or earn the credit, or you can forward them \nseparately to the tax centre that serves the corporation. \nReference \nSubsection 152(6) \nHow to file a formal dispute \nMany misunderstandings are caused by a lack of \ninformation or by a simple miscommunication. That’s why \nthe CRA says: “Talk to us.” \nIf you have new or additional information, you or your \nauthorized representative can ask for a change online at \nMy Business Account, Represent a Client, or by writing to \nthe CRA. Many disputes are resolved this way. \nIf you disagree with an assessment or a determination, you \ncan make a formal objection. \nFiling an objection is the first step in the formal process of \nresolving your dispute. You have 90 days after the date of \nthe notice of assessment or determination to file an \nobjection. \nYou can file an objection: \n■ online in My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra \n-business-account, or in Represent a Client at \ncanada.ca/taxes-representatives, by selecting “File a \nformal dispute (Notice of Objection)” under \n“Corporation Income Tax” \n■ by mail, using Form T400A, Notice of Objection – Income \nTax Act, or writing to the chief of appeals at your \nAppeals Intake Centre (see appendix B of Guide P148) \nIn all cases, you have to explain why you disagree and \ninclude all relevant facts and supporting documents. \nFor large corporations, your objection must: \n■ reasonably describe each issue \n■ specify for each issue the relief you are seeking, \nexpressed as the amount of a change in the income, \ntaxable income, loss, taxes payable, refundable amounts, \nand overpayments or balance of unclaimed outlays, \nexpenses, or other amounts of the corporation \n■ provide facts and reasons the corporation relied on for \neach issue \nReference \nSection 165 \nA large corporation that objects to an assessment will have \nto pay 50% of the disputed amount. A corporation is a large \ncorporation if the total taxable capital employed in Canada \nat the end of the tax year by the corporation and its related \ncorporations is over $10 million. The corporation also has to \npay the full amount of taxes not in dispute. \nReference \nSubsection 225.1(7) \nFor more information about objections and appeals, see \nGuide P148, Resolving your dispute: Objection rights under the \nIncome Tax Act, or go to canada.ca/cra-file-objection. \nDisputing loss determinations \nThe formal process of resolving a dispute does not usually \napply to loss amounts under dispute, because there is no \ntax, interest, or penalty involved. \nHowever, a corporation may request a loss determination if \nit does not agree with the amount of the losses assessed by \nthe CRA. The CRA will determine the amount of the loss \nand confirm in writing by issuing Form T67AM, Notice of \nDetermination/Redetermination of a Loss. \nOnce the corporation has received the notice of \ndetermination, it can file an objection within 90 days after \nthe date of the notice. \nNote \nYou cannot request a loss determination if the CRA \nassessed your loss to be the same as what you reported. \nIf the corporation asks, the CRA will make determinations \nof the following amounts: \n■ a non-capital loss \n■ a net capital loss \n■ a restricted farm loss \n■ a farm loss \n■ a limited partnership loss \nSend any requests for loss determinations to your tax \nservices office or tax centre. \nReferences \nSubsections 152(1.1) and 152(1.2)\n\n\n\n=== Page 23 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n23\nKeeping records \nKeep your paper and electronic records for six years from \nthe end of the last tax year that they relate to.

You do not need approval for the \nchanged tax year. \nFile a return for the tax year that ends immediately before \ncontrol is acquired. The next tax year starts at the time \ncontrol is acquired, and the corporation can choose any tax \nyear-end within the next 53 weeks. \nIf control is acquired up to seven days after the end of an \nestablished tax year, generally a corporation can choose to \nextend the tax year up to the time control is acquired. In \nthis case, attach a letter to your return that says you are \nmaking an election under paragraph 249(4)(b). \nWhere shares of a corporation are transferred to an estate \nbecause of a death, there is no acquisition of control. In \ngeneral, this also applies when the transfer is made to a \nrelated person. As a result, there is no deemed tax year-end \nand no tax return is required to be filed. For more \ninformation, see subsection 256(7). \nNotes \nThe acquisition of control under subsection 256(9) of a \ncorporation is usually deemed to occur at the beginning \nof the day on which the acquisition takes place. \nHowever, the particular time of day that the acquisition \nof control took place will be recognized if the \ncorporation makes an election under subsection 256(9). \nTo elect under subsection 256(9), include a note with \nyour return for the tax year ending immediately before \ncontrol was acquired and enter the hours and minutes \nthat specify the time of day at line 065. \nThe deeming rule does not apply when determining the \nstatus of a corporation as a small business corporation or \na Canadian-controlled private corporation at the time of \nthe transaction that caused the change of control. The \nstatus of the corporation will not change until the actual \ntime of the acquisition. \nLine 066 – Is the date on line 061 a \ndeemed tax year-end according to \nsubsection 249(3.1)? \nIf at any time a corporation becomes or stops being a \nCanadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) for any \nreason other than an acquisition of control, \nsubsection 249(3.1) provides that the tax year of the \ncorporation is deemed to end immediately before that \nchange. You do not need the minister’s approval for the \nchanged tax year. \nFile a return for the tax year that ends immediately before \nthe change. The next tax year is deemed to start on the date \nthat the corporation type changed, and the corporation can \nchoose any tax year-end within the next 53 weeks. \nIf the change occurs up to seven days after the end of an \nestablished tax year and there has not been an acquisition \nof control and the corporation has not become or stopped \nbeing a CCPC, within those seven days the corporation can \nchoose to extend the tax year up to the time the change \noccurred. In this case, attach a letter to your return that says \nyou are making an election under paragraph 249(3.1)(c). \nLine 067 – Is the corporation a professional \ncorporation that is a member of a \npartnership? \nA professional corporation is a corporation that carries on \nthe professional practice of an accountant, dentist, lawyer, \n(including a notary in the province of Quebec), medical \ndoctor, veterinarian, or chiropractor. \nBilled-basis accounting for professional corporations \nFor tax years that begin after March 21, 2017, professional \ncorporations are not allowed to use billed-basis accounting \nanymore.

If you do not file \nSchedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed. \nReference \nIT-126, Meaning of “Winding up” \nLine 076 – Is this the final tax year before \namalgamation? \nPredecessor corporations filing their last returns have to \nanswer yes to this question on their final returns. \nWhen two or more corporations amalgamate, each of the \npredecessor corporations has to file a return for the period \nending immediately before the effective date of \namalgamation. The effective date of amalgamation is \ngoverned by corporate law. Generally, the effective date is \non the certificate of amalgamation or the letters patent of \namalgamation. \nNote \nThe CRA cannot accept returns filed for the period \nending just before a date that is not the effective date of \namalgamation. \nReference \nS4–F7–C1, Amalgamations of Canadian Corporations \nLine 078 – Is this the final return up to \ndissolution? \nYou have to answer yes if you have already permanently \ndissolved your corporation with the incorporating \nauthority and you are filing your final return for a tax year \nending on the date of dissolution. You will find the date of \ndissolution on the articles of dissolution. \nThe responsible representative has to get a clearance \ncertificate from the tax services office before distributing \nany of the corporation’s property under his or her control. \nBy getting the certificate, the responsible representative will \navoid being personally liable for the unpaid taxes, interest, \nand penalties. Include Schedule 100, Balance Sheet \nInformation, with the final return, which shows how the \nassets were distributed. \nNote \nIf you want to dissolve your corporation, you should \nsend an application for dissolution to the government \nbody that governs the affairs of your corporation. \nOnce the corporation has been dissolved, you should \nconsult Form RC145, Request to Close Business Number \nProgram Accounts, to determine whether you need to \ncomplete that form and send the CRA the articles of \ndissolution. Otherwise, the CRA considers that the \ncorporation still exists, and it will have to file a return even \nif there is no tax payable. \nOnce the corporation is dissolved, any refunds to which the \ncorporation would be entitled revert to the Crown and \ncannot normally be issued to the corporation or its \nrepresentatives unless the charter is reinstated. \nIf the corporation was not involuntarily dissolved and the \ncharter is not reinstated, a refund can be issued if all returns \nhave been filed up to the date of dissolution for all revenue \nlines (T2, GST, and other levies returns) and the refund is \nissued to one of the following: \n■ the sole shareholder of the corporation \n■ a legal representative of the corporation when there are \nmultiple shareholders \nIf these conditions are not met, the refund will remain with \nthe Crown. \nReferences \nSubsection 159(2) \nIC82-6, Clearance Certificate \nLine 079 – If an election was made under \nsection 261 \nIf the return is not reported in Canadian currency, indicate \nthe functional currency used. \nCorporations resident in Canada throughout the tax year \ncan elect to report in a functional currency, except for: \n■ investment corporations \n■ mortgage investment corporations \n■ mutual fund corporations \nA functional currency is a currency of a country other than \nCanada that is both: \n■ a qualifying currency (currently, the British pound, the \neuro, the Australian dollar, the U.S. dollar, and the \nJapanese yen) \n■ the primary currency in which the taxpayer keeps its \nrecords and books of account for financial reporting \npurposes for the tax year\n\n\n\n=== Page 29 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n29\nTo elect to report in a functional currency, file Form T1296, \nElection, or Revocation of an Election, to Report in a Functional \nCurrency, within the first 61 days of the tax year to which \nthe election applies. \nNote \nEven if you elect to report in a functional currency, you \nstill have to complete line 840 in Canadian currency. \nYou cannot change functional currency.

Control can be exerted \neither directly or indirectly in any way. A person or a \ngroup of persons can control a corporation. Keep in mind \nthat, in this context, a person can be either an individual or \na corporation. \nControl includes both de jure control and de facto control. \nDe jure control is the right of control that depends on a \nperson owning enough shares of a corporation to give that \nperson a majority of the voting power. De facto control, or \nfactual control, occurs when a corporation is subject to any \ndirect or indirect influencing that, if exercised, would result \nin actual control being exerted. \nWhen determining whether a taxpayer has any direct or \nindirect influence that, if exercised, would result in factual \ncontrol of the corporation, one must: \n■ take into consideration all factors that are relevant in the \ncircumstances \n■ not be limited to whether the taxpayer has a legally \nenforceable right or ability to make a change in the board \nof directors of the corporation, or the board’s power, or \nto exercise influence over the shareholder(s) who have \nthat right or ability. The previous factors are not \nmandatory in determining factual control \nIn general, a corporation is associated with another \ncorporation if it meets one of the following six conditions at \nany time in the tax year. Remember that controlled means \ndirectly or indirectly in any way. \nCondition 1 \nThe corporations are associated if one corporation controls \nthe other. \nExample \nCorp X owns 100% of the voting shares of Corp Y, which in \nturn owns 51% of the voting shares of Corp Z. \nCorp X is associated with Corp Y because it exerts direct \ncontrol over it. \nCorp X is associated with Corp Z because it exerts indirect \ncontrol over it. \n \nCondition 2 \nThe corporations are associated if both corporations are \ncontrolled by the same person or group of persons. \nCorporations may be associated because the same group of \npersons controls both corporations, but the members of this \ngroup do not act together and have no other connection to \neach other. \nCCPCs that are associated only because of this definition of \na group will NOT be considered associated when: \n■ calculating the refundable investment tax credit on \nqualified SR&ED expenditures \n■ calculating the expenditure limit \n■ allocating the expenditure limit \nFor this exception to apply, one of the corporations must \nhave at least one shareholder who is not common to both \ncorporations. \nThe corporations will continue to be associated for all other \npurposes of the Income Tax Act. \nExample \nBob owns 40% of the voting shares of Corp ABC and 30% of \nthe voting shares of Corp XYZ. Ike owns 20% of the voting \nshares of Corp ABC and 40% of the voting shares of \nCorp XYZ. \nAs a group, Bob and Ike control both companies. \nCorps ABC and XYZ are associated. \n \nCondition 3 \nThe corporations are associated if all of the following apply: \n■ each corporation is controlled by one person \n■ that person is related to the person controlling the other \ncorporation \n■ one of those persons owns at least 25% of the issued \nshares of any class, other than shares of a specified class, \nof the capital stock of each corporation\n\n\n\n=== Page 33 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n33\n \nExample \nBilly owns 100% of the issued share capital of Corp AB. He \nalso owns 25% of the class A shares (other than shares of a \nspecified class) of Corp CD, whose controlling shareholder \nis Billy’s brother. \nCorps AB and CD are associated. \n \nCondition 4 \nThe corporations are associated if all of the following apply: \n■ one corporation is controlled by one person \n■ that person is related to each member of a group of \npersons who controls the other corporation \n■ that person owns at least 25% of the issued shares of any \nclass, other than shares of a specified class, of the capital \nstock of the other corporation \nExample \nBuddy controls Corp AY. His two daughters control \nCorp AZ. Buddy also owns 50% of the class A preferred \nshares of Corp AZ. \nCorps AY and AZ are associated. \n \nCondition 5 \nThe corporations are associated if all of the following apply: \n■ each corporation is controlled by a related group \n■ each of the members of one of the related groups is \nrelated to all members of the other related group \n■ one or more persons who are members of both related \ngroups, either alone or together, own at least 25% of the \nissued shares of any class, other than shares of a specified \nclass, of the capital stock of each corporation \nExample \nAnne and her two daughters control Corp One. Anne and \nher two sons control Corp Two. Anne owns 33% of the \ncommon shares in each corporation. \nCorps One and Two are associated. \n \nCondition 6 \nUnder subsection 256(2), two corporations that are not \nassociated with each other will be considered associated if \nthey are associated with the same corporation (the third \ncorporation). Special rules apply for determining the small \nbusiness deduction. See Schedule 28, Election not to be \nAssociated Through a Third Corporation, on page 34 for \ndetails. \nExample \nCorp AB owns 100% of the issued share capital of Corp CD. \nIt also owns 25% of the class A shares (other than shares of \na specified class) of Corp XY, whose controlling \nshareholder is Billy. Billy’s brother controls Corp AB. \nCorps AB, CD, and XY are associated. \n \nReferences \nSection 251 \nSubsections 256(1), (1.1), (1.2), (2), and (5.1) \nIT-64, Corporations: Association and Control \nSchedule 23, Agreement Among Associated \nCanadian-Controlled Private Corporations to \nAllocate the Business Limit \nAll CCPCs that are associated have to file Schedule 23. \nThis schedule is used to: \n■ identify all the corporations to establish: \n– the date the balance of tax is due (see “Balance-due \nday” on page 14) \n– the calculation of the reduction to the business limit \n■ allocate a percentage of the business limit to each \nassociated corporation.

Corp A and Corp B change their \nyear-ends to match Corp C’s year-end. \nThe corporations decide to allocate a $300,000 business \nlimit to Corp C for the December 31, 2024, year-end. \nBecause the total of their business limits cannot be more \nthan $500,000, the corporations allocate $90,000 to Corp A \nand $110,000 to Corp B. \nQuestion \nWhat is Corp A’s business limit for each of the two tax \nyears ending in the 2024 calendar year? \nAnswer \nTax year ending June 30, 2024: \nBecause the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, Corp A \nprorates the business limit for the number of days in the tax \nyear as follows: \n$100,000  × 181 days  =  $49,589 \n \n \n365 days \nNote \n365 is not adjusted for a leap year. \nTax year ending December 31, 2024: \nBecause the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, Corp A \nprorates the business limit for the number of days in the tax \nyear. Corp A uses the $90,000 business limit allocated in \nthis tax year, because it is less than the $100,000 business \nlimit allocated in its first tax year ending in 2024. \nCorp A prorates the business limit as follows: \n$90,000  × 184 days  =  $45,370 \n \n \n365 days \nNote \n365 is not adjusted for a leap year. \n \nReference \nSubsection 125(5) \nSchedule 49, Agreement Among Associated \nCanadian-Controlled Private Corporations to \nAllocate the Expenditure Limit \nAll CCPCs that are associated and have scientific research \nand experimental development (SR&ED) expenditures \nhave to file Schedule 49. These corporations use this form \nto: \n■ identify all the associated corporations \n■ allocate the expenditure limit for the 35% ITC rate on \nqualifying SR&ED expenditures \nFor more details about the ITC, see Lines 652 and 780 on \npage 88. \nNote \nOnly one of the associated or related corporations needs \nto file Schedule 49 for a calendar year. However, if \nSchedule 49 is not already on file when the CRA assesses \nany of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar \nyear of the agreement, it will ask for one. \nAssociated corporations with more than one tax year in \na calendar year \nSpecial rules apply to determine the expenditure limit for \nassociated corporations that have more than one tax year \nending in the same calendar year. Prorate the expenditure \nlimit for each tax year ending in the calendar year based on \nthe number of days in the tax year divided by 365. \nBe sure that the amount you prorate for each of the tax \nyears is equal to the amount allocated to the corporation \nfor the first tax year ending in the calendar year. \nReferences \nSubsections 127(10.3) and 127(10.6) \nSchedule 28, Election not to be Associated \nThrough a Third Corporation \nFile Schedule 28 if a CCPC that is associated with two other \ncorporations elects under subsection 256(2) for the \ntwo other corporations not to be associated with each other \nfor the purposes of the small business deduction. \nNote \nTwo corporations (Corps A and B) that are not \nassociated with each other are considered associated \nunder subsection 256(2) if they are associated with the \nsame corporation (the third corporation). \nWhen the CCPC (the third corporation) makes this election, \nits business limit for the small business deduction is \nconsidered to be zero. \nInvestment income received from either of the two other \ncorporations’ active business will be ineligible for the small \nbusiness deduction as it will not be treated as active \nbusiness income. \nCorps A and B remain associated with the CCPC.

\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS) when it prepared its financial \nstatements? \nIf the corporation used the IFRS to prepare its financial \nstatements, answer yes to this question. \nThe IFRS is mandatory for all publicly accountable \nenterprises. This includes corporations that have calculated \ntheir financial statements in accordance with the IFRS but \nhave not complied with all aspects of the IFRS. A \ncorporation that has issued, or is in a process of issuing, \npublicly-traded debt or equity instruments or who holds \nassets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders \nis generally considered to be a publicly accountable \nenterprise. \nFor the first year when IFRS is adopted, corporations are \nrequired to maintain additional documentation to support \namounts filed on the General Index of Financial \nInformation (GIFI) and tax returns. For more information \non IFRS books and records and other IFRS topics, go \nto canada.ca/international-financial-reporting-standards \n-ifrs. \nLine 280 – Is the corporation inactive? \nEven if a corporation is inactive, which means it has not \noperated during the tax year, it has to file a return. \nNote \nCorporations that are inactive throughout the tax year \nand that do not have balance sheet or income statement \ninformation to report do not have to attach \nschedules 100, 125, and 141 to their T2 return. However, \nthey will be accepted if filed. \nLines 284 to 289 – Specify the principal \nproducts mined, manufactured, sold, \nconstructed, or services provided, giving the \napproximate percentage of the total revenue \nthat each product or service represents \nIf you file electronically, enter the proper North American \nIndustry Classification System (NAICS) code before \ncompleting lines 284 to 289. If you do not select the \nbusiness activity, you will have problems and errors when \nyou prepare the T2 return to be transmitted electronically \nor printed in bar-code format. \nBreak down the business activity into the following \ncategories: \n■ the principal products mined, manufactured, sold, or \nconstructed \n■ the services provided \nAlso, give the approximate percentage of the corporation’s \ntotal revenue that each product or service represents. \nLine 290 – Did the corporation meet the \ndefinition of substantive CCPC under \nsubsection 248(1) at any time in the tax year? \nSubstantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using foreign \nentities \nA private corporation that is a Canadian-controlled private \ncorporation (CCPC) is subject to refundable Part I tax, such \nthat in certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for a \nprivate corporation to cease to be a CCPC. Tax planning \nstrategies have developed that rely on a loss of CCPC status \nbefore the realization of investment income. \nThe concept of substantive CCPC eliminates this potential \nadvantage by taxing passive income earned by a \nsubstantive CCPC in the same way as if the corporation \nwas a CCPC. \nA substantive CCPC is a private corporation (other than a \nCCPC) that at any time in a tax year: \n■ is controlled, directly or indirectly in any way, by one or \nmore Canadian resident individuals, or \n■ would, if each share of the capital stock of a corporation \nthat is owned by a Canadian resident individual were \nowned by a particular individual, be controlled by the \nparticular individual \nFurther, a corporation is considered a substantive CCPC \nwhen the corporation would be a CCPC but for the fact that \na non-resident or public corporation has a right to acquire \nits shares. \nMeasures regarding the deferral of tax using foreign \nentities generally apply to tax years ending after \nApril 6, 2022, except that the measures apply to tax years \nstarting after April 6, 2022, if both the following apply: \n■ the corporation’s first tax year ending after April 6, 2022, \nis because of an acquisition of control caused by the sale \nof all or substantially all of the shares of a corporation to \nan arm’s length purchaser before 2023 \n■ the corresponding written purchase and sale agreement \nwas entered into before April 7, 2022 \nCCPC and substantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using \nforeign resident corporations \nChanges to the foreign accrual property income (FAPI) \nrules eliminate the tax deferral advantage that was \navailable to CCPCs and their shareholders earning \ninvestment income through a controlled foreign affiliate. \nThese measures, which affect both CCPCs and substantive \nCCPCs, apply to tax years starting after April 6, 2022. \nAside from the two measures above, substantive CCPCs \nwill continue to be treated as non-CCPCs for all other \npurposes of the Income Tax Act. \nLine 291 – Did the corporation immigrate to \nCanada during the tax year? \nTick the yes or no box.\n\n\n\n=== Page 41 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n41\nLine 292 – Did the corporation emigrate from \nCanada during the tax year? \nTick the yes or no box. \nLine 293 – Do you want to be considered as a \nquarterly instalment remitter, if you are \neligible? \nA small-CCPC is eligible to make quarterly instalment \npayments if it meets certain conditions. To determine if you \nare eligible, see Guide T7B–Corp, Corporation Instalment \nGuide. \nLine 294 – If the corporation was eligible to \nremit instalments on a quarterly basis for part \nof the tax year, provide the date the \ncorporation ceased to be eligible. \nIndicate the date that the corporation ceased to be eligible \nto remit instalments on a quarterly basis. \nLine 295 – If the corporation’s major business \nactivity is construction, did you have any \nsubcontractors during the tax year? \nTick the yes or no box. \nMajor business activity \nAll individuals, partnerships, and corporations whose \nprincipal business activity is construction have to report \npayments made to subcontractors. For these purposes, \nconstruction is defined as erecting, installing, altering, \nmodifying, repairing, improving, demolishing, \ndismantling, or removing any structure or part, including \nbut not limited to buildings, roads, and bridges. \nWho is a subcontractor? \nA subcontractor is an individual, partnership, or \ncorporation that provides construction services. \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/t5018-slip. \nCalculating net income or loss \nThere are several schedules you may have to use to \ncalculate the net income or loss for income tax purposes. \nThis section explains each of those schedules. \nSchedule 1, Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax \nPurposes \nEffective January 1, 2024, any deduction from income from \nnon-compliant short-term rentals is disallowed to the extent \nof the non-compliant amount. On line 295 of Schedule 1, \nenter the non-deductible amount for non-compliant short-\nterm rentals. \nGenerally, the net income (loss) reported on your financial \nstatements will not be the same as the net income (loss) \nrequired for tax purposes. This is because certain income \nand expenses reported on your financial statements or the \nGeneral Index of Financial Information (GIFI) may not be \nused in the calculation of net income (loss) for tax purposes. \nFor example, you do not deduct charitable donations when \ndetermining net income for tax purposes, as you would to \narrive at net income on your financial statement. \nNote \nCharitable donations are deducted (afterward) from net \nincome for tax purposes to arrive at taxable income. \nUse Schedule 1 to reconcile the net income (loss) reported \non your financial statements and the net income (loss) \nrequired for tax purposes. \nEnter net income or loss after income tax and extraordinary \nitems at amount A, page 1 of Schedule 1. Add the taxable \nitems and the non-allowable expenses listed on lines 101 \nto 199 and subtract from this the non-taxable items and \neligible expenses listed on lines 401 to 499. \nAdditions and deductions identified on lines 101 to 132 \nand 401 to 418 of Schedule 1 are the most common \nadditions and subtractions. For other additions and \ndeductions, see pages 3 and 4. \nSome expenses deducted on your income statement are not \nallowable for income tax purposes and are not identified on \nSchedule 1. In this case, use columns 605 and 295, and \nline 296, “Other additions”, on page 3. \nAlso, certain items included in income that are not taxable \nare not identified on this schedule. In such cases, complete \ncolumns 705 and 395, and line 396, “Other deductions”, on \npage 4. \nNotes \nOnly complete lines 203 and 302 if you are converting \nfrom an accrual basis to a cash basis. Otherwise, these \nlines should be left blank. \nThe deductible portion of expenses you incurred for \nfood, beverages, and entertainment is only 50% of \nwhichever is less: the expenditure actually incurred or \nthe amount that would be reasonable in the \ncircumstances. \nEighty percent of expenses for food and beverages \nconsumed by a long-haul truck driver during an eligible \ntravel period are deductible. For more information, see \nGuide T4002, Self-Employed Business, Professional, \nCommission, Farming, and Fishing Income, or go \nto canada.ca/taxes-employment-expenses and select \n“Transportation employees.” \nA full deduction is allowed for meals provided to an \nemployee at a temporary construction work camp, if \ncertain conditions are met. For more information on this \nsubject, go to canada.ca/taxable-benefit. \nTaxable capital gains or allowable capital losses allocated \nby a partnership to a corporate partner are not included \non line 129 of Schedule 1 of the corporate partner. \nInstead, the corporate partner’s share of the \npartnership’s capital gain or loss should be reported on \nSchedule 6 of the corporate partner. \nYou may have to use the following schedules to calculate \ncertain amounts on Schedule 1: \n■ Schedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of Capital Property (for \ndetails, see below)\n\n\n\n=== Page 42 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n42\n■ Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) (see page 45) \n■ Schedule 12, Resource-Related Deductions (see page 64) \n■ Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves (see page 64) \n■ Schedule 16, Patronage Dividend Deduction (see page 65) \n■ Schedule 17, Credit Union Deductions (see page 65) \n■ Schedule 73, Income Inclusion Summary for Corporations \nthat Are Members of Partnerships (see page 15) \n■ Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental \nDevelopment (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim (see page 65) \nSchedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of \nCapital Property \nYou have to complete Schedule 6 if you disposed of capital \nproperty during the tax year and incurred any capital \nlosses or realized any capital gains. You also have to \ncomplete this schedule if you claim an allowable business \ninvestment loss. \nReferences \nSection 54 \nIT-170, Sale of Property – When Included in Income Computation \nIT-448, Dispositions – Changes in Terms of Securities \nIT-460, Dispositions – Absence of Consideration \nS3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance \nDesignation under paragraph 111(4)(e) \nAnswer yes or no to the question on line 050, page 1 of \nSchedule 6. \nYou can make a designation under paragraph 111(4)(e) if a \nperson or group of persons has acquired control of the \ncorporation. If you make the designation, capital properties \nwill be considered as having been disposed of immediately \nbefore that person or group of persons acquired control of \nthe corporation. \nCompleting Schedule 6 \nTo help you complete Schedule 6, the following \nexplanations briefly set out the type of information to enter \nin each column and each part of the schedule. \nDate of acquisition \nIn this column, give the date you acquired the property. \nProceeds of disposition \nIn this column, indicate the proceeds of disposition. The \nproceeds of disposition are usually the selling price of the \nproperty. However, they can also include compensation \nthe corporation received for property that was destroyed, \nexpropriated, stolen, or damaged. \nFor a gift or a deemed disposition, the proceeds of \ndisposition are usually the fair market value of the property \nwhen its owner or use changes. \nReferences \nSection 54 \nS3-F3-C1, Replacement Property \nAdjusted cost base \nIn this column, indicate the cost of the property you used to \ncalculate any capital gain or loss. This amount is called the \nadjusted cost base (ACB). The ACB is the original cost of \nthe property that has been adjusted to reflect certain \ntransactions or occurrences that took place after acquiring \nthe property. \nThe cost of a capital property may be the actual cost, a \ndeemed cost, or the valuation-day value of the property. \nThe nature of the property and the circumstances under \nwhich you acquired it determine which cost of the capital \nproperty you should use. \nReferences \nSubsections 53(1) and 53(2) \nThe cost of property acquired after 1971 is usually the \nactual cost of acquiring it, including the purchase price plus \nany related costs, such as commissions, legal fees, and other \nreasonable expenses. It also includes the cost of additions \nand improvements to the property. It does not include \ncurrent expenses, such as maintenance and repair costs. \nSpecial rules apply when determining the cost of capital \nproperty owned on December 31, 1971. According to these \nrules, tax is not assessed and losses are not allowed for any \ngain or loss that arose before that date. \nWhen deductions from the cost base of a property (other \nthan a partnership interest) reduce the balance to a negative \namount at any time in the tax year, you are considered to \nhave realized a capital gain equal to the amount of the \nnegative balance, and the ACB becomes nil. \nYou cannot use later additions to the ACB to reduce \nprevious gains on the property that resulted from a \nnegative balance. You can only consider these additions \nwhen you determine future gains or losses. \nReference \nSubsection 40(3) \nParagraphs 53(1)(e) and 53(2)(c) outline the rules for \ndetermining the ACB of a partnership interest. \nYou have to reduce the ACB of a partnership interest by the \namount of any share purchase tax credit, and one-half of \nany scientific research and experimental development tax \ncredit the partnership allocated to the corporation. \nNote \nInterests in a partnership that a limited partner or an \ninactive partner holds are subject to the negative \nACB rule. \nOutlays and expenses \nIn this column, enter the amount of outlays and expenses \nyou deducted when calculating a gain or loss. You can \ndeduct most cash outlays the corporation used to put a \nproperty into saleable condition when you calculate a gain \nor loss. You can also deduct expenses incurred when \ndisposing of the property. These expenses include certain \nfixing-up costs, finder’s fees, commissions, surveyor’s fees, \ntransfer taxes, and other reasonable expenses incurred to \ndispose of the property. \nGain (or loss) \nIn the last column, enter the amount of the gain or loss as \ninstructed. \nA capital gain results when the proceeds of disposition of a \ncapital property are more than the ACB and any related \noutlays or expenses. A capital loss occurs when the \nproceeds of disposition are less than the ACB and the \nrelated outlays and expenses. However, if depreciable\n\n\n\n=== Page 43 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n43\nproperty is disposed of, it will result in a terminal loss, not \na capital loss. See “Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated \ncapital cost) on page 51 for more details about terminal \nlosses. \nIn certain cases, when you dispose of a building and the \nland on which it stands, and the building is disposed of for \nless than its undepreciated capital cost, you may have to \nreduce the gain on the sale of the land by the terminal loss \non the sale of the building. \nReference \nSubsection 13(21.1) \nIf you dispose of crypto-assets and other similar properties \nother than in the course of a business that you operate or an \nadventure in the nature of trade, the CRA may consider any \nresulting gain or loss to be a capital gain or capital loss. For \nmore information, go to canada.ca/cra-crypto-assets or see \nGuide T4037, Capital Gains. \nCategories of capital property \nThere are six categories of capital property you may have \ndisposed of during the tax year. The categories are: \n■ shares \n■ real estate \n■ bonds \n■ other properties \n■ personal-use property \n■ listed personal property \nThe first six parts of Schedule 6 reflect these six categories \nof capital property. \nPart 1 – Shares \nIn this part, list the shares disposed of during the tax year. \nGive the number of shares, the name of the corporation in \nwhich the shares were held, and the class of the shares. \nUsually, disposing of a share of the capital stock of a \ncorporation will result in a taxable capital gain or an \nallowable capital loss. However, if the corporation that is \ndisposing of the share is in the business of trading shares, \nthe resulting gain or loss is considered business income or \nloss. \nIf a share is converted because of a merger or an \namalgamation, subsection 248(1) deems a disposition to \nhave occurred. \nUnder paragraph 112(3)(b), a corporation (the shareholder) \nmust reduce the losses from the disposition of shares held \nas capital property by certain dividends received for those \nshares. This is called a stop-loss rule. Generally, this rule \ndoes not apply when the shareholder owns less than 5% of \nthe shares and has held these shares for over a year. \nOn line 160, enter the total adjustment for such losses \nidentified in Part 1. Enter the total amount of gain or loss \nrealized on disposition of shares at amount A. \nReference \nIT-328, Losses on Shares on Which Dividends Have Been Received \nPart 2 – Real estate \nIn this part, list all real estate disposed of during the tax \nyear. Give the municipal address of each property. \nDispositions of non-depreciable real property (unless the \nproperty is inventory) may result in a capital gain or loss. \nHowever, dispositions of depreciable property may result \nin a capital gain, a recapture of CCA, or a terminal loss. \nSee ”Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated capital cost) on \npage 51 for details about terminal losses and recaptures. \nEnter the total amount of gain or loss realized on \ndisposition of real estate at amount B. \nReference \nIT-218, Profit, Capital Gains and Losses From the Sale of Real Estate, Including \nFarmland and Inherited Land and Conversion of Real Estate From Capital \nProperty to Inventory and Vice Versa \nPart 3 – Bonds \nIn this part, list all bonds disposed of during the tax year. \nGive the face value, the maturity date, and the issuer’s \nname for each type of bond. \nWhen you make a capital disposition of a debt obligation, \nthe amount of any realized discount or bonus received is \nusually considered a capital gain. Similarly, a premium \npaid is considered a capital loss, either when the obligation \nmatures or on the date you dispose of the obligation. \nEnter the total amount of gain or loss realized on \ndisposition of bonds at amount C. \nReference \nIT-479, Transactions in Securities \nPart 4 – Other properties \nIn this part, describe any capital property disposed of \nduring the tax year that you have not already reported in \nParts 1, 2, and 3. \nOther property includes capital debts established as bad \ndebts, debts in respect of the disposition of personal-use \nproperty established as bad debts, amounts that arise from \nforeign currency transactions, as well as capital gains or \nlosses allocated from partnerships and trusts. \nWhen an amount receivable on a capital account becomes \na bad debt and you elect on your return to have the \nprovisions of subsection 50(1) applied, a deemed \ndisposition occurs at the end of the year. You are \nconsidered to have reacquired the debt immediately \nafterwards at a cost of nil. This usually allows the \ncorporation to claim a bad debt as a capital loss in the year. \nAny later recovery of that debt will result in a capital gain. \nReferences \nSubsection 50(1) \nIT-159, Capital Debts Established to be Bad Debts \nYou can deduct, per subsection 50(2), capital losses in \nrespect of bad debts relating to the disposition of \npersonal-use property to a person with whom you deal at \narm’s length. \nThe amount of the loss cannot be more than the amount of \nthe gain reported on the disposition of the personal-use \nproperty. \nReference \nSubsection 50(2) \nForeign exchange gains or losses from buying or selling \ncapital properties are capital gains or capital losses.\n\n\n\n=== Page 44 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n44\nTransactions in foreign currency or foreign currency futures \nthat do not form part of the business operations can be \nconsidered capital dispositions. \nReferences \nSubsection 39(2) \nIT-95, Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses \nFor dispositions of depreciable property, a capital gain \nresults if the proceeds are more than the capital cost. \nHowever, losses on depreciable property do not result in \ncapital losses. These losses are terminal losses. See \n“Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated capital cost) on \npage 51 to find out more about terminal losses. \nEnter the total amount of gain or loss realized on \ndisposition of other properties at amount D. \nPart 5 – Personal-use property \nIn this part, describe any personal-use property you \ndisposed of during the tax year. \nPersonal-use property of a corporation is property owned \nmainly for the personal use or enjoyment of an individual \nwho is related to the corporation. \nUse the $1,000 rule to determine gains and losses when you \ndispose of personal-use property. According to this rule, if \nthe adjusted cost base is less than $1,000, it is considered to \nbe $1,000. As well, when the proceeds of disposition are less \nthan $1,000, they are considered to be $1,000. \nThe $1,000 rule will not apply when donors acquire \npersonal-use property as part of an arrangement in which \nthe property is gifted to a qualified donee, such as a \nregistered charity. \nYou cannot deduct losses on dispositions of personal-use \nproperty (other than listed personal property or a debt that \nis personal-use property) from your income. \nEnter the total amount of gain realized on disposition of \npersonal-use property at amount E. \nReference \nSubsection 46(1) \nPart 6 – Listed personal property \nIn this part, describe any listed personal property disposed \nof during the tax year. \nListed personal property is a special category of \npersonal-use property that usually increases in value. The \nfollowing is a complete list of the different types of listed \npersonal property: \n■ prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other \nsimilar works of art \n■ jewellery \n■ rare folios, rare manuscripts, or rare books \n■ stamps \n■ coins \nIf you incur losses from disposing of listed personal \nproperty, you can only deduct these losses from capital \ngains realized from disposing of listed personal property. \nOn line 655, enter the amount of listed personal property \nlosses from previous years you want to apply against \ncurrent-year net listed personal property gains. Also, enter \nthis amount on line 530 of Schedule 4, Corporation Loss \nContinuity and Application. \nYou can apply any unabsorbed losses in the current year to \nreduce similar net gains realized in the three preceding \nyears, and in the following seven years. See “Part 5 – Listed \npersonal property losses” on page 68 for more details. \nAt amount F, enter the total amount of gains or losses \nrealized on disposition of listed personal property minus \nthe amount of line 655. \nPart 7 – Property qualifying for and resulting in an \nallowable business investment loss \nGenerally, a business investment loss arises from the arm’s \nlength disposition (or deemed disposition) of: \n■ shares of a small business corporation \n■ certain debts owed to the corporation by a small business \ncorporation, certain bankrupt corporations, or certain \nwound-up corporations (these corporations have to deal \nwith the corporation at arm’s length) \nA small business corporation is defined in subsection 248(1). \nComplete Part 7 to calculate the business investment losses \nat amount G. \nCapital gains reserve \nOften, you will not receive part of the proceeds of \ndisposition, usually for real property, until after the end of \nthe year. In these cases, you can defer part of the capital \ngain to the year the corporation is due to receive the \nproceeds by setting up a capital gains reserve. By using \nreserves, you can spread a capital gain over a maximum of \nfive years. \nGenerally, a corporation that has made a gift of a \nnon-qualifying security to a qualified donee may claim a \nreserve for any gain realized on this security. The reserve \nclaimed by the corporation cannot exceed the eligible \namount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift is the \namount by which the fair market value of the property that \nis the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of the \nadvantage, if any, in respect of the gift. \nA reserve can only be claimed if the donation is not \ndeducted for tax purposes and the donee does not dispose \nof the security or the security does not cease to be a \nnon-qualifying security. This reserve can only be claimed in \ntax years ending within 60 months of making the gift. \nThe reserve must be included in income if the corporation \nbecomes a non-resident or tax exempt. \nThe reserve that you can claim in a tax year cannot be more \nthan the lesser of the following two amounts: \nA.          Capital gain           × Amount not due until after \n \nProceeds of disposition  \n \nthe end of the year \nand \nB. \n■ for the year of disposition \n4/5 of the capital gain \n \n■ for the second year \n3/5 of the capital gain \n \n■ for the third year \n2/5 of the capital gain \n \n■ for the fourth year \n1/5 of the capital gain\n\n\n\n=== Page 45 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n45\nAdd the reserve amount you deducted in a tax year to \nincome in the following tax year. \nAdd the reserve opening balance and subtract the reserve \nclosing balance on lines 880 and 885 of Schedule 6. \nShow the continuity of capital gain reserves on Schedule 13, \nContinuity of Reserves. See page 64 for details. \nReferences \nSubparagraphs 40(1)(a)(ii) and 40(1)(a)(iii) \nSubsection 40(1.01) \nPart 8 – Capital gains or losses \nWhen completing this part, line 875 is the capital gains \ndividends. Capital gains dividends under \nparagraphs 130.1(4)(a) and (b) and 131(1)(a) and (b) are \nconsidered to be capital gains. These paragraphs apply to \nmortgage investment corporations and mutual fund \ncorporations. If you received any capital gains dividends in \nthe tax year, enter them on this line. \nLine 880 is the balance at the beginning of the year of the \ncapital gains reserve from Schedule 13. This amount should \ninclude any amount from the last tax year of predecessor \ncorporations after amalgamation or wind-up. \nPart 9 – Taxable capital gains and total capital losses \nGenerally, a zero inclusion rate applies for capital gains \narising as a result of a gift to qualified donees of certain \nsecurities or of environmentally sensitive land. The zero \ninclusion rate is restricted to only part of the capital gain if \nthe taxpayer is entitled to an advantage or benefit in respect \nof a gift. \nWhen completing this part, line 895 is the full amount of \ncapital gains realized on donations of a security listed on a \ndesignated stock exchange, a share or unit of a mutual \nfund, an interest in a segregated fund, or a prescribed debt \nobligation made to a qualified donee. \nGenerally, if you donate property to a qualified donee that \nis included in a flow-through share class of property, and \nyou have an exemption threshold for the flow-through \nshare class of property, you may be deemed to have an \nadditional capital gain from the disposition of another \ncapital property subject to the 50% inclusion rate. \nAmounts under section 34.2 (the adjusted stub period \naccrual regime) that have the character of capital are to be \nentered in this part of Schedule 6 and not on line 130 of \nSchedule 1. \nSince these amounts are deemed to be taxable capital \ngains/allowable capital losses under the rules in \nsection 34.2 and so already reflect the 50% inclusion rate, \nthey are multiplied by 2 on Schedule 6 to calculate the total \ncapital gains or losses of the corporation. \nIn general, if you dispose of an interest in a partnership to \ntax-exempt entities, non-resident persons, or partnerships \nand trusts that have such members or beneficiaries, a \nspecial rule may apply. \nUnder subsection 100(1), part of the capital gain may be \nsubject to the 50% inclusion rate and another part may be \nsubject to a 100% inclusion rate. \nThe portion of the capital gain that can reasonably be \nattributed to increases in the value of capital property \n(other than depreciable property) held directly by the \npartnership (or held indirectly by the partnership through \none or more other partnerships) is subject to the 50% \ninclusion rate and the rest is subject to the 100% inclusion \nrate. \nIf all the partnership assets are inventory, depreciable \nproperty, or resource property, then the capital gain would \nbe subject to the 100% inclusion rate unless an exception \napplies. If there is also capital property (other than \ndepreciable property), then it’s an apportionment. \nIf subsection 100(1) applies, enter the result of the portion \nof the capital gain that is subject to the 100% inclusion rate \nmultiplied by 2 on line 902. Enter the portion of the capital \ngain that is subject to the 50% inclusion rate in Part 4. \nAmount P is the capital gain or loss for the year. If the \namount is a loss, enter it at amount Q of Schedule 6 and \nline 210 of Schedule 4. If the amount is a gain, enter the \nresult of amount P multiplied by 1/2 at amount R of \nSchedule 6 and line 113 of Schedule 1. \nReferences \nSubsections 40(12) and 100(1) \nParagraphs 38(a.1) and 38(a.2) \nYou can deduct an ABIL from all sources of income for the \nyear. If any balance remains after the year the loss occurs, \nit becomes part of the non-capital loss. You can carry the \nnon-capital loss back 3 tax years and carry it forward 10 tax \nyears. \nIf you are unable to deduct an ABIL as a non-capital loss \nwithin this allowed time frame, the unused part becomes a \nnet capital loss, and you can carry it forward indefinitely to \nreduce taxable capital gains. \nInclude all unused ABIL after the applicable carry-forward \nperiod in Part 2, “Capital losses”, of Schedule 4. See \npage 67, for more details. \nReferences \nParagraph 39(1)(c) \nS4-F8-C1, Business Investment Losses \nSchedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) \nParagraph 20(1)(a) allows a corporation to deduct part of \nthe capital cost of certain depreciable property from \nincome it earned in the year from a business or property. \nThis deduction is called capital cost allowance. \nComplete Schedule 8 to calculate CCA. \nWhen a tax year is shorter than 12 months, you generally \nhave to prorate the CCA. \nUnder Part XI of the Income Tax Regulations, depreciable \nproperty is grouped into prescribed classes. Schedule II of \nthe Regulations contains a complete list of these prescribed \nclasses. \nA maximum rate is prescribed for each class. Apply the \nprescribed rate to the undepreciated capital cost of the class \nat year-end to determine the maximum CCA you can claim. \nYou can deduct any amount up to the maximum that is \navailable for the year. \nDisability-related modifications \nYou can deduct outlays and expenses you incur for eligible \ndisability-related modifications made to a building in the\n\n\n\n=== Page 46 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n46\nyear you paid them, instead of having to add them to the \ncapital cost of your building. Eligible disability-related \nmodifications include changes you make to accommodate \nwheelchairs. You can also deduct expenses paid to install or \nget disability-related devices and equipment. \nYou can claim this as “Other deductions” on Schedule 1, \nNet Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes. \nAvailable-for-use rule \nThe available-for-use rule determines the earliest tax year in \nwhich you can claim CCA for depreciable property. \nWhen is property available for use? \nProperty other than a building is considered available for \nuse at the earliest of several dates. The following are some \nexamples of these dates: \n■ when the corporation first uses the property to earn \nincome \n■ the beginning of the first tax year that starts at \nleast 358 days after the tax year during which the \ncorporation acquired the property \n■ immediately before the corporation disposes of the \nproperty \n■ when the corporation can use the property to either \nproduce a saleable product or perform a saleable service \nA building is considered available for use on the earliest of \nthe following dates: \n■ when the corporation uses all or substantially all of the \nbuilding for its intended purpose \n■ when construction of the building is completed \n■ the beginning of the first tax year that starts at \nleast 358 days after the tax year during which the \ncorporation acquired the property \n■ immediately before the corporation disposes of the \nproperty \n■ when the corporation acquires a replacement property, \nif it is replacing one it involuntarily disposed of \n(for example, expropriation) that it either acquired \nbefore 1990 or had already become available for use \nNote \nIf a corporation acquires a property for a long-term \nproject, it can elect to limit the impact of the \navailable-for-use rule. This election is not available for \nrental buildings. To make this election, send the CRA a \ncompleted Form T1031, Subsection 13(29) Election in \nRespect of Certain Depreciable Properties, Acquired for use in \na Long Term Project, with your return. \nReferences \nSubsections 13(26) to 13(32) \nElection under Regulation 1101(5q) \nLine 101 – Is the corporation electing under \nRegulation 1101(5q)? \nTick the yes or no box. \nThis election allows you to include certain property usually \nincluded in classes 8 and 43 in a separate class. You have to \nhave acquired each property at a capital cost of at least \n$1,000. The types of properties that qualify for this election \ninclude manufacturing and processing property, \nphotocopiers, and electronic communications equipment, \nsuch as facsimile transmission devices or telephone \nequipment. \nYou can elect to classify a property in a separate class or \nseveral properties in one or more than one separate class. \nThis election can allow you to claim a terminal loss, which \nis any remaining undepreciated capital cost at the time of \ndisposition of the properties in this class. For more \ninformation on terminal losses, see “Column 10 – UCC” \n(undepreciated capital cost). \nCCA rates and classes \nPurpose-built rental housing – Class 1 \nUnder proposed changes, an accelerated CCA rate of 10% \nunder class 1 would be available for new eligible purpose-\nbuilt rental housing projects that: \n■ begin construction after April 15, 2024, and before 2031, \nand \n■ are available for use before 2036 \nInvestments eligible for this measure would continue to \nbenefit from the accelerated investment incentive (AII). The \nAII currently suspends the half-year rule, providing a CCA \ndeduction at the full rate for eligible property that becomes \navailable for use before 2028. \nEligible property would be new purpose-built rental \nhousing that is a residential complex: \n■ with at least 4 private apartment units (a unit with a \nprivate kitchen, bathroom, and living areas) or 10 private \nrooms or suites, and \n■ in which at least 90% of residential units are held for \nlong-term rental \nIf the above conditions are met, the new rate would also be \navailable to: \n■ projects that convert existing non-residential real estate, \nsuch as an office building, into a residential complex \n■ new additions to an existing residential complex \nThe accelerated CCA would not apply to renovations of \nexisting residential complexes. \nProductivity-enhancing assets – Classes 44, 46, and 50 \nUnder proposed changes, for new additions of property to \nCCA classes 44, 46, and 50, immediate expensing (a 100% \nfirst-year deduction) would be provided if the property is \nacquired after April 15, 2024, and becomes available for use \nbefore 2027. Property that becomes available for use in 2027 \nwould continue to benefit from the AII. \nZero-emission vehicles – Classes 54 and 55 \nTwo CCA classes (54 and 55) were added for zero-emission \nvehicles (ZEVs) acquired after March 18, 2019. \nClass 55 was created for zero-emission vehicles otherwise \nincluded in class 16, essentially automobiles for lease or \nrent and taxicabs, with the same CCA rate of 40%. Class 54 \nwas created for zero-emission vehicles that would \notherwise be included in class 10 or 10.1, essentially other\n\n\n\n=== Page 47 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n47\nautomobiles, with the same CCA rate of 30%. The CCA still \napplies on a declining-balance basis. \nA corporation may elect to not include in class 54 or 55 a \nvehicle that would otherwise be a zero-emission vehicle. \nWhen such an election is filed, the vehicle will no longer be \nconsidered to be a zero-emission vehicle. As a result, the \nvehicle will be included in its usual CCA class 10, 10.1 \nor 16. A corporation has to file this election with the \nminister of National Revenue in its return of income for the \ntax year in which the vehicle is acquired. \nAn eligible zero-emission vehicle is essentially a motor \nvehicle for use on streets and highways (excluding a trolley \nbus or vehicle operated only on rails). It must be fully \nelectric, or a plug-in hybrid that has a battery capacity of at \nleast 7 kWh, or fully powered by hydrogen. It must not \nhave been used, or acquired for use, for any purpose before \nit was acquired by the corporation, unless the corporation \nacquires it after March 1, 2020. \nIt cannot be a vehicle: \n■ for which the Government of Canada paid assistance \nunder a prescribed program such as the federal purchase \nincentive announced in the 2019 federal budget \n(presently there is only one prescribed program) \n■ that the corporation elected not to include in class 54 \nor 55 \n■ for which an amount has been deducted as CCA or a \nterminal loss has been claimed by another person or \npartnership \nIn addition, a zero-emission vehicle has to be acquired, and \nbecome available for use, after March 18, 2019, and \nbefore 2028. An enhanced first-year CCA is available as \nfollows: \n■ 100% after March 18, 2019, and before 2024 \n■ 75% after 2023 and before 2026 \n■ 55% after 2025 and before 2028 \nUnder proposed changes, the immediate expensing \nmeasure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for \nqualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, \nand that becomes available for use before 2030, with a \nfour-year phase out after 2029. \nFor the enhanced first-year allowance, the following step \nshould be done before calculating the CCA: \n■ increase the net capital cost addition to the new class for \nproperty that becomes available for use before 2028 as \nfollows: \n– For class 54, increase the capital cost addition by an \namount equal to: \n■ 2 1/3 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use before 2024 \n■ 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025 \n■ 5/6 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use after 2025 and \nbefore 2028 \n– For class 55, increase the capital cost addition by an \namount equal to: \n■ 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use before 2024 \n■ 7/8 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025 \n■ 3/8 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use after 2025 and \nbefore 2028 \n■ suspend the existing CCA half-year rule \nMultiply the result by the prescribed CCA rate of 30% for \nclass 54 and 40% for class 55. \nThe CCA will apply to any remaining balance for the new \nclasses using the set rate for each class. \nThese measures do not change the total amount that can be \ndeducted over the life of the vehicle, it just allows a larger \ndeduction in the first year. \nA zero-emission passenger vehicle is an automobile that is \nincluded in class 54. When the capital cost of a \nzero-emission passenger vehicle is more than a prescribed \namount ($61,000 plus sales tax for vehicles acquired on or \nafter January 1, 2023), the capital cost of the vehicle is \ndeemed to be the prescribed amount. This amount will be \nreviewed annually. \nIf a zero-emission passenger vehicle is disposed of to a \nperson or partnership with which the corporation deals at \narm’s length and its cost is more than the prescribed \namount, the proceeds of disposition will be adjusted based \non a factor equal to the prescribed amount as a proportion \nof the actual cost of the vehicle. But for dispositions made \nafter July 29, 2019, the actual cost of the vehicle will be \nadjusted for payment or repayment of government \nassistance. \nZero-emission vehicles – Class 56 \nA temporary enhanced first-year capital cost \nallowance (CCA) of 100% is available for eligible \nzero-emission automotive equipment and vehicles (other \nthan motor vehicles) that currently do not benefit from the \naccelerated rate provided by classes 54 and 55. These \nvehicles and equipment are included in class 56. They have \nto be acquired after March 1, 2020, and become available for \nuse before 2028. \nThe enhanced CCA applies only for the tax year in which \nthe equipment or vehicle first becomes available for use. It \nis subject to the following phase-out: \n■ 100% after March 1, 2020, and before 2024 \n■ 75% after 2023 and before 2026 \n■ 55% after 2025 and before 2028 \nUnder proposed changes, the immediate expensing \nmeasure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for \nqualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, \nand that becomes available for use before 2030, with a \nfour-year phase out after 2029. \nTo be eligible for the enhanced first year allowance, a \nvehicle or equipment must be automotive (that is,\n\n\n\n=== Page 48 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n48\nself-propelled) and fully electric or powered by hydrogen. \nVehicles or equipment that are powered partially by \nelectricity or hydrogen (which includes hybrid vehicles and \nvehicles that require human or animal power for \npropulsion) are not eligible. \nClass 56 captures automotive equipment that is not \ndesigned for use on highways or streets such as \nzero-emission aircraft, watercraft, trolley buses and railway \nlocomotives. Additions or alterations may qualify if they \nconvert automotive equipment (other than a motor vehicle) \ninto a zero-emission property. \nThe CCA is deductible on any remaining balance on a \ndeclining balance basis at a rate of 30%. \nAn election is available to not include the vehicle or \nequipment in class 56. As a result, the property will then be \nincluded in the class for which it would otherwise be \neligible. \nClass 56 excludes property for which CCA or a terminal \nloss has previously been claimed by another person or \npartnership where the equipment was acquired by the \ncorporation on a tax-deferred “rollover” basis or it was \npreviously owned or acquired by the corporation or a \nnon-arm’s length person or partnership. \nAccelerated investment incentive property \nAccelerated investment incentive property (AIIP) is a \nproperty (other than property included in classes 54 to 56) \nthat is acquired by the corporation after November 20, 2018, \nand becomes available for use before 2028. \nUnder proposed changes, the accelerated investment \nincentive measure would be reinstated for qualifying \nproperty acquired on or after January 1, 2025, and that \nbecomes available for use before 2030, with a four-year \nphase out after 2029. \nThe property has to meet one of the following conditions: \n■ no person or partnership (including the corporation) has \nclaimed capital cost allowance (or a terminal loss) for the \nproperty \n■ it has not been transferred to the corporation on a \ntax-deferred “rollover” basis \n■ it was not previously owned or acquired by the \ncorporation or a non-arm’s length person or partnership \nThe following measures are available to AIIP: \n■ Accelerated investment incentive – Providing an \nenhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible \nproperty that is subject to the CCA rules. In general, the \nincentive is made up of two elements: \n– an increase up to 50% of the net capital cost addition to \na class for property that becomes available for use \nbefore 2024 \n– suspending the existing CCA half-year rule (and \nequivalent rules for Canadian vessels and class 13 \nproperty) for property that becomes available for use \nbefore 2028. \n \nNote \nUnder the half-year rule, in general, property other \nthan AIIP or property included in classes 54 to 56, \nacquired during the tax year, is eligible for only 50% of \nthe normal maximum CCA for the year. You can claim \nfull CCA for that property in the next tax year. See \nRegulation 1100(2). \n■ Full expensing for manufacturers and processors – \nAllowing businesses to immediately write off the full \ncost of machinery and equipment used for the \nmanufacturing or processing of goods (class 53 or \nproperty included in class 43 and acquired after 2025, if \nthe property would have been included in class 53 if it \nhad been acquired in 2025). \n■ Full expensing for clean energy investments – Allowing \nbusinesses to immediately write off the full cost of \nspecified clean energy equipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). \nA phase-out will begin for property that becomes available \nfor use after 2023. For the 2024 and 2025 years, corporations \nmay immediately write off 75% of specified clean energy \nequipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). \nUnder proposed changes, the immediate expensing \nmeasure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for \nqualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, \nand that becomes available for use before 2030, with a \nfour-year phase out after 2029. \nAn enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible \nCanadian development expenses and Canadian oil and gas \nproperty expenses incurred after November 20, 2018, and \nbefore 2028. The enhanced deduction will begin to be \nphased out for expenses made after 2023. \nThe accelerated investment incentive applies to property \nfor which CCA is calculated on a declining-balance basis \n(including class 14.1, intangible property), as well as \nproperty with straight-line depreciation (for example, \nleasehold improvement, patents, and limited period \nlicences). A phase-out will begin for property that becomes \navailable for use after 2023. \nIn certain situations, rules related to limited partners, \nspecified leasing properties, specified energy properties \nand rental properties can restrict a CCA deduction, or a loss \nfor such a deduction, that would otherwise be available. \nThese rules continue to apply. \nThe accelerated investment incentive does not change the \ntotal amount that can be deducted over the life of the \nproperty, it just allows a larger deduction in the first year. \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/taxes-accelerated \n-investment-income. \nReference \nRegulation 1104(4) \nS3-F8-C2, Tax Incentives for Clean Energy Equipment \nDesignated immediate expensing property \nDesignated immediate expensing property (DIEP) is a \nproperty (other than property included in classes 1 to 6, \n14.1, 17, 47, 49 and 51) that is acquired by a CCPC after \nApril 18, 2021, becomes available for use in the tax year and \nbefore 2024, is designated as such in prescribed form filed \nby the CCPC within 12 months of the filing-due date for the \ntax year the designation relates to.\n\n\n\n=== Page 49 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n49\nThe property has to meet one of the two following \nconditions: \n■ it has never been used and no person or partnership has \nclaimed capital cost allowance (or a terminal loss) for the \nproperty \n■ it has not been transferred to the corporation on a tax \ndeferred “rollover” basis and it was not previously \nowned or acquired by the corporation or a non-arm’s \nlength person or partnership \nSchedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA), is the prescribed \nform for the immediate expensing claim. \nThe immediate expensing incentive has the following \ncharacteristics: \n■ it allows CCPCs to immediately write off the full cost of \nthe DIEP up to $1.5 million per tax year \n■ it applies only to the DIEP \n■ it is available only for the year in which the property \nbecomes available for use \n■ it is limited to $1.5 million per tax year, which will be \nshared among associated members of a group and \nprorated for tax years shorter than 365 days. If the capital \ncost of the DIEP is more than $1.5 million and is included \nin more than one CCA class, the CCPC can decide to \nwhich CCA class the immediate expensing incentive is \nattributed \nNote \nThe immediate expensing deduction does not need to be \nprorated for a short tax year, as the immediate expensing \ndeduction is already limited to the corporation’s \nprorated immediate expensing limit for the tax year. \nThis applies to tax years ending after April 18, 2021. \nThe carryforward of excess capacity for CCPCs with less \nthan $1.5 million of eligible capital costs is not allowed. \nExisting enhanced CCA deductions will not reduce the \namount available under this measure. \nFor details, see examples 6 and 7 under the heading \n“Schedule 8 examples” that follows. \nCompleting Schedule 8 \nThis section explains how to complete each column of \nSchedule 8. Use a separate line for each class of property. \nReference \nS3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance \nComplete Part 1 if you are associated (under \nsubsection 1104(3.6) of the Regulations) in the tax year with \none or more eligible persons or partnerships (EPOPs) with \nwhich you have entered into an agreement. The purpose of \nthe agreement is to assign a percentage to one or more of \nthe EPOPs in the tax year to share the immediate expensing \nlimit. \nEPOP refers to a corporation that was a CCPC throughout \nthe year, an individual (other than a trust) resident in \nCanada throughout the year or a Canadian partnership all \nof the members of which were individuals (other than \ntrusts) or CCPCs throughout the period. \nIn the table, give the names of the associated EPOPs, their \nidentification number and the percentage assigned under \nthe agreement. Also provide the immediate expensing limit \nallocated to you. Such amount should be based on the \npercentage assigned to your corporation in column 3. If the \nsum of the percentages assigned under the agreement is \nmore than 100%, the immediate expensing limit of the \nassociated group is nil. \nReference \nRegulations 1104(3.1) to (3.6) \nComplete Part 2 to calculate your CCA deduction. \nColumn 1 – Class number \nIdentify each class of property with the assigned class \nnumber. \nGenerally, you have to group all depreciable property of \nthe same class together. Then, calculate CCA on the \nundepreciated capital cost of all the property in that class. \nHowever, sometimes you have to maintain property of the \nsame class in separate lines. For example, list on separate \nlines property that you would usually group in the same \nclass but use to earn income from different sources. Also, \nlist on a separate line each class 10.1 passenger vehicle and \nproperty you elected to identify in a separate class under \nRegulation 1101(5q). \nNote \nIf a class number has not been provided in Schedule II \nof the Income Tax Regulations for a particular class \nof property, use the subsection provided in \nRegulation 1101 or 1100. \nReference \nRegulations 1100 and 1101 \nColumn 2 – Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the \nbeginning of the year \nEnter the amount of the undepreciated capital cost at the \nend of the previous tax year. \nColumn 3 – Cost of acquisitions during the year \nFor each class, enter the total cost of depreciable property \nyou acquired in the tax year. Depreciable property is \nconsidered acquired when it becomes available for use. See \npage 46 for more information on the available-for-use rule. \nReduce the capital cost of a property by the following \namounts: \n■ goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) \ninput tax credit claimed or entitled to be claimed, or \nrebate received or entitled to be received in the year \n■ federal investment tax credits (ITCs), other than scientific \nresearch and experimental development ITCs, used to \nreduce taxes payable or claimed as a refund in the \nprevious tax year \n■ reduction of capital cost after the application of section 80 \n■ provincial or territorial ITCs received or entitled to be \nreceived in the current year \n■ government assistance received or entitled to be received \nin the year and described under paragraph 13(7.1)(f) \n■ deemed decrease, under subsection 13(40), to the \nundepreciated capital cost of class 14.1 where you\n\n\n\n=== Page 50 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n50\nacquired property of that class through a non-arm’s \nlength transfer and the property had been eligible capital \nproperty of the transferor before January 1, 2017 \nAdd to the capital cost of the property: \n■ deemed increase, under subsection 13(39), to the \nundepreciated capital cost of class 14.1 where you \ndisposed of property of that class after \nDecember 31, 2016, and that property had been eligible \ncapital property before January 1, 2017 \n■ repayment of GST/HST input tax credit previously \nclaimed \n■ government assistance repaid in the year that previously \nreduced the capital cost and described under \nparagraph 13(7.1)(d) \nThe cost of acquisitions generally means the full cost of \nacquiring the property, including legal, accounting, \nengineering, and other fees. Land is not a depreciable \nproperty, and is therefore not eligible for CCA. List any \nacquisitions that are not subject to the 50% rule, separately. \nSee Regulations 1100(2) and (2.2) for more information \nabout these types of acquisitions.

They are included in column 8 and shown separately \nin column 9. \nColumn 10 – UCC \nTo calculate the amount you have to enter in column 10, do \nthe following: \n■ add the amounts in columns 2 and 3 \n■ either subtract or add the amount in column 5 (subtract if \nit is a negative amount, or add if it is a positive amount) \n■ subtract the amount in column 8 \nYou cannot claim CCA in the following situations: \n■ the amount in column 10 is positive, and no property is \nleft in that class at the end of the tax year (a terminal \nloss) \n■ the amount in column 10 is negative (a recapture of \nCCA) \nTerminal loss \nA terminal loss results when you dispose of all the \nproperty in a particular class and there is an amount of \nundepreciated capital cost left in column 10. You have to \ndeduct the terminal loss from income. If applicable, enter \nthe positive amount from column 10 in column 22. For \ndetails, see example 1 under the heading “Schedule 8 \nexamples” that follows. \nRecapture of CCA \nIf the amount in column 10 is negative, you have a \nrecapture of CCA. A recapture of CCA occurs when the \nproceeds of disposition in column 8 are more than the total \nof columns 2 and 3, plus or minus the amount in column 5 \nof that class. \nYou have to add the recapture to income. If applicable, \nenter the negative amount from column 10 in column 21 as \na positive. For details, see example 2 under the heading \n“Schedule 8 examples” that follows. \nThe recapture and terminal loss rules do not apply to \npassenger vehicles in class 10.1. However, the recapture \nrules do apply to a passenger vehicle that was, at any time, \na DIEP. \nOnce you have entered the recapture or terminal loss from \ncolumn 10 in column 21 or 22, do not complete columns 23 \nand 24 for that line. \nColumn 11 – UCC of the DIEP \nEnter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in \ncolumn 4. That amount should not exceed the UCC amount \nreported in column 10. \nColumn 12 – Immediate expensing \nThe immediate expensing for CCPCs is the lesser of the \nfollowing two amounts: \n■ the immediate expensing limit for the tax year \n■ the UCC of the DIEP for the tax year (amount from \ncolumn 11) \nThe immediate expensing limit is equal to one of the \nfollowing five amounts, whichever is applicable: \n■ $1.5 million, if the CCPC is not associated (under \nsubsection 1104(3.6) of the Regulations) with any \nother EPOP in the tax year \n■ the immediate expensing limit allocated to the CCPC in \nPart 1 of Schedule 8, if the CCPC is associated with one \nor more EPOPs in the tax year and you entered into an \nagreement with them under subsection 1104(3.3) of the \nRegulations \n■ nil, if the CCPC is associated with one or more EPOPs in \nthe tax year and: \n– the total of the percentages assigned in the agreement \nis more than 100% or \n– the CCPC has not filed an agreement in prescribed \nform as required under subsection 1104(3.3) of the \nRegulations \n■ the amount determined under subsection 1104(3.5) of the \nRegulations for any second or subsequent tax years \nending in a calendar year, if the CCPC has two or more \ntax years ending in the calendar year in which it is \nassociated with another EPOP that has a tax year ending \nin that calendar year \n■ any amount allocated by the minister under \nsubsection 1104(3.4) of the Regulations\n\n\n\n=== Page 52 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n52\nThe immediate expensing limit has to be prorated if your \ntax year is less than 365 days. \nReference \nRegulations 1100(0.1) and 1104(3.1) to (3.6) \nColumn 13 – Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class \nColumn 13 represents the cost of acquisitions that are not \neligible for the immediate expensing incentive. This \nincludes properties that are not DIEP or are DIEPs that \nhave exceeded the immediate expensing deduction for the \ntax year. \nTo calculate the amount you have to enter in column 13, do \nthe following: \n■ add the amount in column 3 \n■ subtract the amount in column 12 \nColumn 14 – Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are \naccelerated investment incentive property (AIIP) or \nproperties included in classes 54 to 56 \nFor each class, enter the total cost of the AIIP or properties \nincluded in classes 54 to 56 that you acquired during the \nyear. They are included in column 13 and shown separately \nin column 14. \nAIIP generally means a property, other than property \nincluded in classes 54 to 56, acquired after \nNovember 20, 2018, and that becomes available for use \nbefore 2028. \nFor more details, see “Zero-emission vehicles –Classes 54 \nand 55”, on page 46, “Zero-emission vehicles – Class 56”, \non page 47, and “Accelerated investment incentive \nproperty”, on page 48. \nReferences \nRegulation 1104(4) \nSchedule II of the Regulations \nColumn 15 – Remaining UCC \nColumn 15 represents the remaining portion of UCC after \napplying the immediate expensing deduction. The \nremaining portion of UCC will be used to calculate the \nCCA deduction under subsection 1100(1) of the \nRegulations. \nSubtract the amount in column 12 from the amount in \ncolumn 10 and enter the difference. \nReference \nRegulation 1100(0.2) \nColumn 16 – Proceeds of disposition available to reduce \nthe UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 \nWhen you purchase an AIIP or a property included in \nclasses 54 to 56 and a property other than an AIIP and \nproperty included in classes 54 to 56 during the year and a \ndisposition occurs, the disposition first offsets the property \nother than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56. \nThen it reduces the undepreciated capital cost of the AIIP \nor the property included in classes 54 to 56. \nTo calculate the amount you have to enter in column 16, do \nthe following: \n■ add the amount in column 8 \n■ add the amount in column 6 \n■ subtract the amount in column 13 \n■ add the amount in column 14 \n■ subtract the amount in column 7 \nReference \nRegulation 1100(2) \nColumn 17 – Net capital cost additions of AIIP and \nproperty included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the \nyear \nSubtract the amount in column 16 from the amount in \ncolumn 14 and enter the difference. \nReference \nRegulation 1100(2) \nColumn 18 – UCC adjustment for AIIP and property \nincluded in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year \nYou must adjust the remaining UCC (from column 15) to \ninclude an accelerated CCA component for accelerated \ninvestment incentive property and any property included \nin classes 54 to 56 that you acquired during the year. \nMultiply the net capital cost of additions from column 17 \nby 0.5 unless a different factor is provided in the legislation. \nReference \nRegulation 1100(2) \nColumn 19 – UCC adjustment for property acquired during \nthe year other than AIIP and property included in classes \n54 to 56 (previously known as the 50% rule) \nGenerally, property acquired during the tax year was only \neligible for 50% of the normal maximum CCA for the year. \nYou could claim full CCA for that property in the next tax \nyear. \nThis 50% rule does not apply to certain property, including \nAIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56. \nTo apply the 50% rule, the remaining UCC of the property \n(from column 15) has to be adjusted. This adjustment is \nequal to half of the net amount of additions to the class (the \nnet cost of acquisitions minus the proceeds of dispositions). \nEnter this amount in column 19. For details, see example 3 \nunder the heading “Schedule 8 examples” that follows. \nWhen applying the 50% rule, do not reduce the net amount \nof additions by the ITC claimed in the previous tax year \nand included in column 5. \nCertain properties acquired through non-arm’s-length \ntransfers or butterfly transfers (which occur in the course of \ncertain reorganizations) are exempt from the 50% rule. \nThe AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 are also \nexempt from the 50% rule. For special rules and exceptions, \nsee Income Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital \nCost Allowance. \nTo calculate the amount you have to enter in column 19, do \nthe following: \n■ subtract the amount in column 14 from the amount in \ncolumn 13 \n■ subtract the amount in column 6 \n■ add the amount in column 7 \n■ subtract the amount in column 8\n\n\n\n=== Page 53 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n53\n■ multiply the result by 0.5 \nReferences \nRegulations 1100(2) and 1100(2.2) \nColumn 20 – CCA rate \nEnter the prescribed rate that applies, as provided for \nunder Part XI of the Regulations. If a specific rate has not \nbeen provided for a particular class of property, enter N/A \nin this column. \nEnter a rate only if you are using the declining balance \nmethod. In this method, the CCA is calculated by \nmultiplying a constant rate by the diminishing balance \nevery year. \nNote \nSome asset classes use the straight-line method to \ncalculate the CCA. In this method, the CCA is calculated \nby dividing the original amount by the number of years \nthat corresponds to the life expectancy of the property. \nTherefore, the deducted amount stays the same from one \nyear to the other (except the first and last year, if the \nhalf-year rule applies for property acquired before \nNovember 21, 2018) and you do not have to enter a rate. \nExample \nDeclining balance method – The capital cost of an asset \nother than an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, \nor a property to which the immediate expensing was \napplied, is $780,000. The rate for the class is 10% with a \nhalf-year rule. \nFirst year:  \n10% × $780,000 = $78,000  \n$78,000 ÷ 2 = $39,000 CCA (half-year rule) \nSecond year:  \n$780,000 – $39,000 = $741,000 (undepreciated capital cost) \n$741,000 × 10% = $74,100 CCA \nThird year: \n$741,000 – $74,100 = $666,900 (undepreciated capital cost) \n$666,900 × 10% = $66,690 CCA \nAnd so on for the following years. \nStraight-line method – The capital cost of an asset other \nthan an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, or a \nproperty to which the immediate expensing was applied, is \n$780,000. The asset’s life expectancy is 10 years and the \nhalf-year rule does not apply. Therefore, the capital cost \nallowance will be $78,000 per year ($780,000 ÷ 10). \n \nClass 13 (property that is a leasehold interest) uses the \nstraight-line method (with the half-year rule for property \nacquired before November 21, 2018). \nAn accelerated investment incentive applies to class 13 for \nproperty acquired after November 20, 2018. See Accelerated \ninvestment incentive property on page 48. \nIf a disposition of all leasehold interests in class 13 occurs \nduring the amortization period, the terminal loss is claimed \nin the year it occurs if the lessee does not acquire a \ndepreciable property that is a leasehold interest before the \nend of the year. \nFor more information on the half-year rule, see Income Tax \nFolio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance. \nColumn 21 – Recapture of CCA \nEnter the amount of recapture from column 10, if \napplicable. Be sure you include the recapture as income. \nEnter the total of amounts from column 21 on line 107 of \nSchedule 1. \nThe recapture rules do not apply to passenger vehicles in \nclass 10.1. However, recapture does apply to a passenger \nvehicle that was, at any time, a DIEP. \nReferences \nSubsections 13(1) and 13(2) \nColumn 22 – Terminal loss \nEnter the terminal loss from column 10, if applicable. \nDeduct the terminal loss from income.

You do not have to claim the \nmaximum allowable CCA. You can claim any amount up to \nthe maximum. \nIf the tax year is less than 365 days, prorate the CCA claim \nfor all property except for those classes of property that \nRegulation 1100(3) excludes. The exceptions in \nRegulation 1100(3) include: \n■ class 14 assets \n■ class 15 assets \n■ timber limits and cutting rights \n■ industrial mineral mines \n■ certified productions \n■ Canadian film or video productions \n■ certain mining equipment in classes 28 and 41\n\n\n\n=== Page 54 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n54\nTo determine the maximum CCA claim, multiply the \nmaximum CCA for a complete year by the number of days \nin the tax year divided by 365. \nReferences \nRegulation 1100(3) \nS4-F15-C1, Manufacturing and Processing \nThe total of all amounts in column 23 is the CCA claim for \nthe tax year.

The accelerated CDE \nor COGPE does not include expenses incurred by a \npredecessor corporation that a successor corporation is \nentitled to claim. It also does not include an expense that is \na cost for Canadian resource property you, or a partnership \nin which you are a member, acquired from a person or \npartnership with which you do not deal at arm’s length. \nThe incentive will be phased out for expenses made \nafter 2023. For more information, go to canada.ca/taxes \n-accelerated-investment-income. \nCanadian exploration expenses and Canadian \ndevelopment expenses \nNote \nEligible expenses related to lithium from brines made on \nor after March 28, 2023, qualify as Canadian exploration \nexpenses and Canadian development expenses. \nCanadian renewable and conservation expense \nIf most of the tangible property in a project is eligible for \ninclusion in class 43.1 or 43.2, certain intangible project \nstart-up expenses (for example, engineering and design \nwork, and feasibility studies) are treated as Canadian \nrenewable and conservation expenses. You can generally \ndeduct these expenses in full in the year you incurred them, \ncarry them forward indefinitely for use in future years, or \ntransfer them to investors using flow-through shares. \nSchedule 12 gives details for the calculations required. \nFlow-through shares \nNote \nThe flow-through share regime is eliminated for oil, gas, \nand coal activities. This means you can no longer \nrenounce oil, gas and coal exploration or development \nexpenditures to a flow-through share investor. This \napplies to expenditures under flow-through share \nagreements entered into after March 31, 2023. \nThe Fall Economic Statement 2018 introduced an \naccelerated rate for Canadian development expenses (CDE) \nthat a flow-through share (FTS) investor receives from a \nprincipal business corporation. This tax measure applies to \naccelerated CDE renounced under FTS agreements entered \ninto after November 20, 2018, for CDE incurred after the \nagreement date and before 2028. \nA principal business corporation needs to inform the \ninvestor that the renounced amount meets the above \nconditions in order for the investor to benefit from the \npermissive accelerated rate for these renounced expenses. \nIf you have invested in an FTS after November 20, 2018, \nand have received a statement of resource expenses from a \nprincipal business corporation, you may generally \nclaim CDE at the rate of 45% in the tax year in which they \nare renounced to you and, thereafter, at a rate of 30%. To \ncalculate the amount of the CDE deduction you are entitled \nto claim, see Schedule 12. \nReferences \nPart XII of the Regulations \nSections 65 and 66 \nSchedule 13, Continuity of Reserves \nYou have to complete Schedule 13 to show the continuity \nof deductible reserves.

This deduction is for payments made \nto customers for allocations in proportion to patronage. An \nallocation in proportion to patronage entitles a customer to \nreceive payment calculated at a rate relating to the quantity, \nquality, or value of either goods or products sold or \nservices rendered. \nCorporations have to pay amounts that qualify for this \ndeduction either during the tax year, or in the 12 months \nthat follow the tax year. \nAn agricultural cooperative corporation for a particular tax \nyear can deduct patronage dividends issued in the form of \ntax deferred cooperative shares, but deductions cannot be \nmore than 85% of its income for that year that is \nattributable to business done with its members. \nCorporations other than credit unions and cooperative \ncorporations cannot deduct patronage dividends paid to \nnon-arm’s length persons. \nParts 1, 2, and 3 of Schedule 16 give details on how to \ncalculate the allowable patronage dividend deduction. \nEnter this deduction on line 416 of Schedule 1. \nIf you are claiming a patronage dividend deduction, you \nalso have to complete Part 5 of Schedule 16 entitled \n“Calculation of income from an active business carried on \nin Canada (ABI).” Enter the amount from line 124 at \nline 400 of the return. \nFile a completed copy of this schedule with your return. \nNote \nEligible members of agricultural cooperative \ncorporations can defer including in income patronage \ndividends in the form of tax deferred cooperative shares \nissued before 2026 to the year of their disposal. \nHowever, a member may elect to have an amount \nincluded in income before the disposition of the shares. \nTo make this election, the member must send a letter \nspecifying the amount to be included in income with \ntheir return for the particular tax year. \nReferences \nSections 135 and 135.1 \nIT-362, Patronage Dividends \nSchedule 17, Credit Union Deductions \nAs a credit union, you may deduct bonus interest payments \nand payments for allocations in proportion to borrowing.

For details, see the \nprovinces’ specific sections on pages 110 and 126 \nrespectively. \nA credit union can deduct from its income for a tax year \nboth the total of all bonus interest payments and the \npayments it made in the year to its members for allocations \nin proportion to borrowing. It can also deduct payments \nmade in the 12 months after the end of the tax year. \nHowever, the credit union cannot deduct an amount if it \ncould have deducted it in the previous tax year. \nThe allocation in proportion to borrowing for a tax year \nmeans an amount a credit union credits to a member that is \nentitled to, or will receive, this amount. \nOn Schedule 17, you have to calculate the payment made \nfor allocations in proportion to borrowing at a rate that is \nrelated to one of the following: \n■ the amount of interest payable by the member on money \nthe member borrowed from the credit union \n■ the amount of money the member borrowed from the \ncredit union \nYou have to calculate the bonus interest payment at a rate \nthat is related to one of the following: \n■ the interest payable by the credit union on money \nstanding to the member’s credit \n■ the amount of money standing to the member’s credit \nThe amount the credit union credited to the member has to \nbear the same rate as the interest or money that the credit \nunion similarly credited to all other members of the credit \nunion of the same class. \nComplete the appropriate parts of Schedule 17 to calculate \nthis deduction.

If the limited partner does not \nreceive this slip because the partnership is exempt from \nfiling, you have to file the partnership’s financial \nstatements with the return to prove the corporation’s \nshare of the partnership loss for the year. \nReport the amount in the corporation’s tax year that the \npartnership’s fiscal period ends in. \nThe part of a partnership loss that a limited partner can \ndeduct in determining net income for income tax purposes \nmay be restricted. \nFor tax years that end after February 26, 2018, it was \nclarified that the at-risk rules apply to a partnership that is \nitself a limited partner of another partnership and that a \ncorporation’s available non-capital loss and limited \npartnership loss carry forward balances have to be adjusted \nas if these rules applied in the preceding years. \nIn column 606, enter the corporation’s at-risk amount at the \nfiscal period ending of the partnership (column 602). The \namount entered in column 604 is from a business (other \nthan a farming or fishing business) or from property. \nIn general terms, you have to calculate a limited partner’s \nat-risk amount as follows: \nthe adjusted cost base of its partnership interest \nplus \nits share of the current-year’s income from the \npartnership \nminus \nall amounts the partner owes to the partnership, and \nany amount or benefit to which the partner is entitled \nthat is intended to protect it from the loss of its \ninvestment \nIn general, interests in partnerships that were operating on \na regular and continuous basis on February 25, 1986, and \ncontinuously thereafter, are exempt from the at-risk rules. \nHowever, partnership interests may lose their exempt \nstatus if, after February 25, 1986, there has been either a \nsubstantial contribution of capital to the partnership or \nsubstantial partnership borrowings. \nThe difference between the corporation’s share of the actual \nloss of the partnership and the corporation’s at-risk amount \n(reduced by any investment tax credit, clean economy tax \ncredit, farming losses and resource expenses the \npartnership allocated to the corporation for that fiscal \nperiod) is called a limited partnership loss. This amount is \nentered in column 620. \nAdd the total of column 620 to line 222 of Schedule 1. Enter \nall those losses in column 670 to establish the continuity of \nlosses. \nReferences \nSubsection 96(2.1) \nIT-232, Losses – Their Deductibility in the Loss Year or in Other Years \nLimited partnership losses from previous tax years that \nmay be applied in the current year \nComplete this part if you want to apply limited partnership \nlosses from previous years to reduce any kind of income in \nthe current year. However, the deductible amount in \nrespect of each partnership is limited to the difference \nbetween the balance of losses for that partnership and the \ncorporation’s at-risk amount for that partnership after \ndeducting the amounts specified under \nsubparagraph 111(1)(e)(ii). \nContinuity of limited partnership losses that can be \ncarried forward to future tax years \nLimited partnership losses can be carried forward \nindefinitely to future years. \nFor this part, column 664 is the amount of limited \npartnership losses transferred from a predecessor \ncorporation after amalgamation, or a subsidiary after \nwind-up, where not less than 90% of the issued shares in \neach class were, immediately before the wind-up, owned \nby the corporation. This amount is the unused limited \npartnership losses available to carry forward at the end of \nthe tax year of the predecessor corporation or subsidiary \nending immediately before the amalgamation or wind-up. \nThe result of this part is the amount of limited partnership \nlosses you carry forward to later years (column 680). \nPart 8 – Election under paragraph 88(1.1)(f) \nFurther to a winding-up of a subsidiary, the part of a \nnon-capital loss, restricted farm loss, farm loss, or limited\n\n\n\n=== Page 70 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n70\npartnership loss incurred by the subsidiary is deemed to be \nthe parent corporation’s loss for its tax year starting after \nthe winding-up has begun. \nParagraph 88(1.1)(f) allows the parent corporation to elect \nthat this loss is deemed to be a loss from its tax year \nprevious to the year mentioned above. \nTick box 190 if you are making an election under \nparagraph 88(1.1)(f). \nTaxable income \nThe following section explains how to calculate the \ndeductions you may be able to claim to reduce net income. \nYou will use these amounts to arrive at your taxable \nincome. \nLine 300 – Net income or (loss) for income tax \npurposes \nOn line 300, enter the net income or loss for income tax \npurposes, as you calculated on Schedule 1. If you did not \nhave to make any adjustments to the net income or loss \nfrom the financial statements or the General Index of \nFinancial Information (GIFI), enter on line 300 the net \nincome or loss from the income statement. Show the \namount of any loss in brackets. \nNote \nOn Schedule 1, do not deduct charitable donations, \ntaxable dividends, net capital losses, non-capital losses, \nfarm losses, or restricted farm losses from other years. \nYou have to deduct these items from net income for \nincome tax purposes to arrive at taxable income. \nLines 311 to 314 \nThe deadline for making donations eligible for tax support \nin the 2024 tax year is proposed to be extended until \nFebruary 28, 2025. \nGifts made before March 2025 are deemed to have been \nmade in a tax year of a corporation that ends after \nNovember 14, 2024, and before 2025 (the \"donation year\"), \nand not in the corporation’s 2025 tax year, if all of the \nfollowing apply: \n■ the gift would be deductible under section 110.1 in \ncomputing the corporation’s taxable income under Part I \nfor the year if it were made immediately before the end \nof the donation year \n■ the corporation deducts the amount of the gift under this \nsection for the corporation’s donation year \n■ the gift was in the form of cash or was transferred by \nway of cheque, credit card, money order or electronic \npayment \nThe amount deductible by the corporation will generally be \nthe eligible amount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift \nis the amount by which the fair market value of the \nproperty that is the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of \nthe advantage, if any, in respect of the gift.

A tracking property is a \nproperty the fair market value of which is determined by \nreference to certain attributes of another property that \nwould be MTM property if held directly by the corporation. \nWhen calculating taxable income, you can deduct, under \nsection 112, any of the following types of taxable dividends \nreceived: \n■ dividends from a taxable Canadian corporation, or from \na corporation resident in Canada and controlled by the \nreceiving corporation \n■ dividends (or a portion of them) from a non-resident \ncorporation (other than a foreign affiliate) that has\n\n\n\n=== Page 73 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n73\ncarried on business in Canada continuously since \nJune 18, 1971 \nThe following types of taxable dividends received are not \ndeductible under section 112: \n■ dividends from a corporation that is exempt from Part I \ntax \n■ dividends on collateralized preferred shares (loss rental \nplans) \n■ dividends that are part of a dividend rental arrangement, \nas defined in subsection 248(1) \n■ dividends on term preferred shares received by certain \nfinancial institutions \n■ dividends on shares guaranteed by a specified financial \ninstitution, as described in subsection 112(2.2) \nReferences \nSubsections 112(1), 112(2), and 112(2.1) to 112(2.9) \nSection 113 contains the authority and the limitations \nconcerning the deduction of dividends received from \nforeign affiliates. \nSubsection 138(6) contains the authority for a life insurer to \ndeduct the taxable dividends received from taxable \nCanadian corporations, other than dividends on term \npreferred shares that are acquired in the ordinary course of \nits business. \nOn line 320, enter the amount of taxable dividends (as per \nSchedule 3) deductible in calculating taxable income under \nsection 112, or 113, or subsection 138(6).

The following three sections explain when income \nfrom these types of businesses may be considered active \nbusiness income and eligible for the SBD. \nSpecified investment business \nA specified investment business is a business with the \nprincipal purpose of deriving income from property, \nincluding interest, dividends, rents, or royalties. It also \nincludes a business carried on by a prescribed \nlabour-sponsored venture capital corporation, the principal \npurpose of which is to derive income from property. \nExcept for a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital \ncorporation, income from a specified investment business is \nconsidered to be active business income, and is therefore \neligible for the SBD if: \n■ the corporation employs more than five full-time \nemployees in the business throughout the year, or \n■ an associated corporation provides managerial, financial, \nadministrative, maintenance, or other similar services to \nthe corporation while carrying on an active business, and \nthe corporation would have to engage more than \nfive full-time employees to perform these services if the \nassociated corporation were not providing them \nNote \nThe business a credit union carries on, or the business of \nleasing property other than real property, is not \nconsidered specified investment business. \nPersonal services business \nA personal services business is a business that a \ncorporation carries on to provide services to another entity \n(such as a person or a partnership) that an officer or \nemployee of that entity would usually perform. Instead, an \nindividual performs the services on behalf of the \ncorporation. That individual is called an incorporated \nemployee. \nAny income the corporation derives from providing the \nservices is considered income from a personal services \nbusiness, as long as both of the following conditions are \nmet: \n■ the incorporated employee who is performing the \nservices, or any person related to him or her, is a \nspecified shareholder of the corporation \n■ the incorporated employee would, if it were not for the \nexistence of the corporation, reasonably be considered an \nofficer or employee of the entity receiving the services \nHowever, if the corporation employs more than \nfive full-time employees throughout the year or provides \nthe services to an associated corporation, the income is not \nconsidered to be from a personal services business. \nTherefore, the income is eligible for the SBD. \nDeductions in computing income for a personal services \nbusiness are restricted to the following: \n■ salary, wages, or other remuneration of the incorporated \nemployee \n■ cost of other benefits or allowances provided to the \nincorporated employee \n■ certain expenses of the corporation associated with \nselling property or negotiating contracts \n■ legal expenses paid in the year by the corporation in \ncollecting amounts owed for services rendered \nNote \nAny expenses denied must be added back on Schedule 1. \nFor more information on the factors to take into account \nwhen a person is considered an employee, see \nGuide RC4110, Employee or self-employed? or go \nto canada.ca/cpp-ei-rulings. \nReference \nParagraph 18(1)(p) \nSpecified corporate income \nGenerally, where a CCPC earns income that would \notherwise be considered as income from an active business \nfrom providing property or services to another private \ncorporation and it (or one of its shareholders) or a person \nwho does not deal at arm’s length with the CCPC (or one of \nits shareholders) holds a direct or indirect interest in that \nother private corporation, the income would not be \nconsidered as being eligible for the SBD unless certain \nconditions are met. \nFor more information, see the definition of specified \ncorporate income in subsection 125(7). \nSpecified farming or fishing income \nThe definition of specified farming or fishing income \nreplaced the definition of specified cooperative income, \nwhich has been retroactively repealed. The definition of \nspecified corporate income excludes specified farming or \nfishing income, so that such income stays eligible for the \nSBD by default. \nSpecified farming or fishing income, of a corporation for a \ntax year, means income of the corporation (other than an \namount included in its income under subsection 135(7), \npatronage dividends), if both of the following conditions \nare met: \n■ the income is from the sale of the farming products or \nfishing catches of the corporation’s farming or fishing \nbusiness to another corporation \n■ the corporation deals at arm’s length with the other \ncorporation \nThis approach eliminates the requirement that sales have to \nbe to a farming or fishing cooperative corporation in order \nto be excluded from specified corporate income.\n\n\n\n=== Page 77 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n77\nNote \nYou have to request a reassessment if, in a previous year \nthat started after March 21, 2016, you had income that \nmeets the definition of specified farming or fishing \nincome, but did not meet the definition of specified \ncooperative income. The CRA can reassess beyond the \nnormal reassessment period for this specific purpose. \nYou will find information on how to request a \nreassessment on page 21. \nSpecified shareholder \nA specified shareholder is a taxpayer who owns, directly or \nindirectly at any time in the year, at least 10% of the issued \nshares of any class of capital stock of the corporation or a \nrelated corporation. \nHow to calculate income from an active business \ncarried on in Canada \nGenerally, to calculate active business income from \ncarrying on a business in Canada, you have to deduct from \nnet income for income tax purposes any of the following \namounts that apply: \n■ taxable capital gains minus allowable capital losses \n■ dividends that are deductible from income under \nsections 112 and 113, and subsection 138(6) \n■ property income minus property losses \n■ property income from an interest in a trust \n■ foreign business income \n■ income from a specified investment business \n■ income from a personal services business \n■ income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition \nof specified corporate income in subsection 125(7) for the \nyear where certain conditions are not met \nSpecified partnership income \nA corporation that is a member (or a designated member) \nof a partnership has to complete Schedule 7 to calculate its \nactive business income. \nThe specified partnership income rules impose a limit on \nthe amount of active business income earned by a \ncorporation as a member or designated member of a \npartnership that is eligible for the SBD. The eligible amount \nis referred to as specified partnership income and is added \nto the corporation’s active business income from other \nsources, if any. \nFor members of a partnership, their specified partnership \nbusiness limit is normally their pro-rata share of a notional \n$500,000 business limit for the partnership. \nFor designated members of a partnership, their specified \npartnership business limit is nil, unless they get an amount \nassigned from a member of the partnership. \nIf the partnership incurs a loss from carrying on an active \nbusiness, you have to deduct the corporation’s share of that \nloss from its active business income. This is referred to as a \nspecified partnership loss. \nIf your corporation is a member of a partnership in respect \nof which it filed a Schedule 73, you have to add or deduct \nthe total active business income determined under \nsection 34.2. \nIf the corporation received an information slip T5013, \nStatement of Partnership Income, that shows its share of \npartnership income or loss, keep it in case the CRA asks for \nit later. Do not include this form with the return. For more \ninformation, see page 35 and Guide T4068, Guide for the \nPartnership Information Return (T5013 Forms). \nOn line 400, enter the total active business income you \ncalculated on Schedule 7. \nReferences \nSubsections 125(1), 125(7), 125(8), and 248(1) \nSection 251 \nIT-73, The Small Business Deduction \nLine 405 – Taxable income for the SBD \nThe taxable income you use to calculate the SBD is usually \nthe amount entered on line 360. However, if you have \nclaimed a foreign non-business income tax credit, a foreign \nbusiness income tax credit, or both, you have to reduce the \ntaxable income by both of the following: \n■ 100/28 of the amount that would be deductible as a \nfederal foreign non-business income tax credit on \nline 632, if that credit was determined without the \nrefundable tax on the CCPC’s investment income \n(line 604) and without reference to the corporate tax \nreduction under section 123.4 \n■ four times the amount that would be deductible as a \nfederal foreign business income tax credit (line 636) if \nthat credit was determined without reference to the \ncorporate tax reduction under section 123.4. See page 79 \nYou also have to reduce taxable income by any amount \nthat, because of federal law, is exempt from Part I tax. \nOn line 405, enter your taxable income for the purposes of \ncalculating the SBD. \nReferences \nParagraph 125(1)(b) \nSubsection 126(7) \nLine 410 – Business limit \nThe maximum allowable business limit for a corporation \nthat is not associated with any other corporation is \n$500,000. \nCCPCs that are associated with one or more corporations \nduring the tax year have to file Schedule 23, Agreement \nAmong Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to \nAllocate the Business Limit.

The refundable portion of Part I tax only \napplies to corporations that are CCPCs throughout the tax \nyear. \nThe refundable portion of Part I tax is based on the \naggregate investment income and foreign investment \nincome. You have to determine these amounts by \ncompleting Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 7, Aggregate \nInvestment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business \nDeduction. \nPart 1 – Aggregate investment income calculation \nThe aggregate investment income is the aggregate world \nsource income calculated as follows: \nadd \n■ the eligible portion of the taxable capital gains for the \nyear that is more than the total of: \n– the eligible portion of allowable capital losses for the \nyear \n– the net capital losses from previous years which are \napplied in the year \n■ total income from property (including income from a \nspecified investment business carried on in Canada other \nthan income from a source outside Canada) from which \nthe following amounts have been deducted: \n– exempt income \n– AgriInvest receipts (include the Quebec amount) \n– taxable dividends deductible after deducting related \nexpenses \n– business income from an interest in a trust that is \nconsidered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a) \ndeduct \n■ total losses for the year from property (including losses \nfrom a specified investment business carried on in \nCanada other than losses from a source outside Canada) \nOn line 440 enter the amount of aggregate investment \nincome that you determined on line 092 of Schedule 7. \nYou can include taxable capital gains and allowable capital \nlosses in a CCPC’s net investment income only if you can \nattribute the gain or loss to a period of time when a CCPC, \nan investment corporation, a mortgage investment \ncorporation, or a mutual fund corporation held the \ndisposed property. \nNote \nPart 2, Adjusted Aggregate Investment Income, of \nSchedule 7, is used to calculate the small business \ndeduction for tax years starting after 2018 on page 4 of \nthe return. \nPart 3 – Foreign investment income calculation \nThe foreign investment income is all income from only \nsources outside of Canada calculated as follows: \nadd \n■ the eligible portion of the taxable capital gains for the \nyear that is more than the eligible portion of allowable \ncapital losses for the year \n■ the total income from property from a source outside \nCanada from which the following amounts have been \ndeducted: \n– exempt income \n– taxable dividends deductible after deducting related \nexpenses \n– business income from an interest in a trust that is \nconsidered property income under paragraph 108(5)(a) \ndeduct \n■ the total losses for the year from property from a source \noutside Canada \nOn line 445 enter the amount of foreign investment income \nthat you determined on line 079 of Schedule 7. \nCalculate the amount of the refundable portion of Part I tax. \nFor years starting after 2018, enter the amount from line 450 \nat amount H in the “Refundable dividend tax on hand” \narea on page 7 of your return. \nReferences \nSubsection 129(4) \nIT-73, The Small Business Deduction \nIT-269, Part IV Tax on Taxable Dividends Received by a Private Corporation or a \nSubject Corporation \nRefundable dividend tax on hand \nThe calculation of a private corporation’s dividend refund \nis based on two accounts, the eligible refundable dividend \ntax on hand (ERDTOH) and the non-eligible refundable \ndividend tax on hand (NERDTOH).\n\n\n\n=== Page 81 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n81\nFor more information on eligible dividends, go to \ncanada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends or see page 94. \nLines 530 and 545 \nThe ERDTOH and NERDTOH accounts only apply to \ncorporations that were private or subject corporations, \nwhich are defined on page 95. \nCCPCs and substantive CCPCs generate NERDTOH on the \nrefundable portion of Part I tax they pay on investment \nincome. They also generate both ERDTOH and NERDTOH \non the Part IV tax they pay on dividends they receive. For \nany other type of private corporation, only the Part IV tax it \npays generates ERDTOH and NERDTOH. \nFor more information on taxable dividends deductible \nunder section 112 or 113, or subsection 138(6), see Line 320 \non page 72. \nFor information on Part IV tax and instructions to complete \nSchedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable Dividends Paid, and \nPart IV Tax Calculations, see Line 712 on page 95. \nAll or part of the ERDTOH and NERDTOH at the end of \nthe tax year may be available as a refund if the corporation \npays taxable dividends to the shareholders during the tax \nyear. \nYou can view the eligible and non-eligible refundable \ndividend tax on hand balances using the “View return \nbalances” service through: \n■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account, if you are the business owner \n■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if \nyou are an authorized representative or employee \nTo calculate the ERDTOH at the end of the tax year, add the \nfollowing amounts: \n■ the ERDTOH balance at the end of the previous tax year \n(minus any dividend refund from ERDTOH issued to the \ncorporation in the previous year) (line 520 minus \namount G) \n■ any balance of ERDTOH transferred from a predecessor \ncorporation on amalgamation, or from a wound-up \nsubsidiary corporation (line 525) \n■ Part IV taxes payable (amount Q) on: \n– eligible dividends received from non-connected \ncorporations \n–  taxable dividends received from connected \ncorporations to the extent that the payment of the \ndividends caused a dividend refund to the payer \ncorporation from its ERDTOH \nTo calculate the NERDTOH at the end of the tax year, \nadd the following amounts: \n■ the NERDTOH balance at the end of the previous tax \nyear (minus any dividend refund from NERTDOH \nissued to the corporation in the previous year) (line 535 \nminus line 575) \n■ the refundable portion of Part I tax (line 450) \n■ any balance of NERDTOH transferred from a \npredecessor corporation on amalgamation, or from a \nwound-up subsidiary corporation (line 540) \n■ Part IV tax payable (excluding amounts allocated to \nERDTOH) (amount P) \nNote \nA predecessor corporation or a subsidiary cannot \ntransfer any ERDTOH or NERDTOH to a new or parent \ncorporation as a result of an amalgamation or wind-up \nif, had the predecessor or subsidiary corporation paid a \ndividend just before the amalgamation or wind-up, \nsubsection 129(1.2) would have applied to that dividend. \nEnter the ERDTOH at the end of the tax year on line 530 \nand at amount BB in the “Dividend refund” area on page 7 \nof your return. Enter the NERDTOH at the end of the tax \nyear on line 545 and at amount EE in the same area. \nReferences \nSubsections 129(4) and 186(5) \nDividend refund \nA private corporation’s eligible dividends generate \ndividend refunds from the ERDTOH. Non-eligible \ndividends generate dividend refunds from the NERDTOH \nfirst, and then possibly from the ERDTOH. The calculation \neffectively requires a private corporation to get a refund \nfrom its NERDTOH account before it gets a refund from \nits ERDTOH account, when it pays a non-eligible dividend. \nNote \nTo claim a dividend refund or to apply the amount to \nanother debit for any tax year, including the same tax \nyear, you have to file your income tax return within \nthree years of the end of the tax year. If your income tax \nreturn is not filed within three years of the end of the tax \nyear, the dividend refund becomes statute-barred, and \nwill not be issued. \nA dividend refund may arise if you pay taxable dividends \nto shareholders, and if there is an amount of NERDTOH \nor ERDTOH at the end of the tax year. Taxable dividends \npaid include the following: \n■ stock dividends \n■ section 84 deemed dividends \n■ amounts paid as interest or dividends on income bonds \nor debentures that are not deductible when calculating \nincome \nTo claim a dividend refund, you must make an actual \npayment to the shareholders unless the dividend is \nconsidered paid (a deemed dividend). This payment can be \neither in cash or with some other tangible assets. In the \nlatter case, the amount of the dividend is the fair market \nvalue of the asset transferred. \nA private or subject corporation may be entitled to a \ndividend refund for dividends it paid while it was a private \nor subject corporation, regardless of whether it was a \nprivate or subject corporation at the end of the tax year. If \nthe corporation loses its private status following a change \nin control, a deemed year-end occurs. The corporation may \nbe allowed to claim a dividend refund for any taxable \ndividends paid during the deemed short year.\n\n\n\n=== Page 82 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n82\nYou have to complete parts 3 and 4 (if they apply) of \nSchedule 3 to claim a dividend refund. \nThe dividend refund is equal to the total of the following \namounts: \n■ for eligible dividends, the amount (referred to below as \namount 1) that is the lesser of 38 1/3% of the total of all \neligible dividends you paid in the year and \nyour ERDTOH account balance at the end of the year \n■ for non-eligible dividends, the total of the two following \namounts: \n– the amount that is the lesser of 38 1/3% of the total of \nall non-eligible dividends you paid in the year and \nyour NERDTOH account balance at the end of the year \n– the amount that is the lesser of: \n■ the amount, if any, by which 38 1/3% of the total of \nall non-eligible dividends you paid in the year is \nmore than your NERDTOH account balance at the \nend of the year \n■ the amount, if any, by which your ERDTOH account \nbalance at the end of the year is more than amount 1 \nThe total of taxable dividends paid in the tax year that \nqualify for a dividend refund is equal to the amount on \nline 460 of Schedule 3. Eligible refundable dividend tax on \nhand refers to line 530 of the return and non-eligible \nrefundable dividend tax on hand refers to line 545. \nParts 3 and 4 of Schedule 3 \nThe following explains how to complete Parts 3 and 4 of \nSchedule 3. Parts 1 and 2 are explained on page 96. \nIf you paid taxable dividends during the year, complete \nPart 3 to identify taxable dividends that qualify for the \ndividend refund. \nIf the amount of dividends paid includes dividends that do \nnot qualify for the dividend refund, you have to deduct \nthese dividends before completing the calculation in Part 3. \nIn this case, complete Part 4 of Schedule 3 to identify \ndividends that do not qualify. \nDividends that do not qualify are: \n■ dividends paid out of the capital dividend account \n■ capital gains dividends \n■ dividends paid for shares that do not qualify as taxable \ndividends, because the main purpose of acquiring the \nshares was to receive a dividend refund \n[subsection 129(1.2)] \n■ taxable dividends paid to a controlling corporation that \nwas bankrupt at any time in the year \nComplete Part 3 of Schedule 3 to identify a connected \ncorporation that received taxable dividends that qualify for \nthe dividend refund. \nIf the dividend refund is more than the amount of Part I tax \npayable for the year, the CRA deducts the excess from any \nother taxes owed under the Income Tax Act. Any balance left \nover is available for a refund. \nIf the total dividends paid during the year is different from \nthe total of taxable dividends paid for the purpose of the \ndividend refund, complete Part 4 of Schedule 3. \nReferences \nSection 129 \nSubsection 186(5) \nParagraph 129(1)(a)\n\n\n\n=== Page 83 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n83\nChapter 7 – Page 8 of the T2 return \n \nPage \n \nPage \nPart I tax ................................................................................ \n83 \nLine 550 – Base amount of Part I tax ................................. \n83 \nLine 560 – Additional tax on personal services \nbusiness income ............................................................... \n83 \nLine 565 – Additional tax on banks and life insurers ..... \n83 \nLine 580 – Total labour requirements addition to tax ..... \n \nLine 602 – Recapture of investment tax credit (ITC) ....... \n83 \nScientific research and experimental development ..... \n84 \nChild care spaces .............................................................. \n84 \nClean economy ................................................................. \n84 \nLine 604 – Refundable tax on CCPC’s investment \nincome ............................................................................... \n84 \nLine 608 – Federal tax abatement ...................................... \n85 \nLine 616 – Manufacturing and processing profits \ndeduction and zero-emission technology \nmanufacturing deduction ............................................... \n85 \nLines 620 and 624 – Investment corporation \ndeduction .......................................................................... \n86 \nLine 632 – Federal foreign non-business income tax \ncredit .................................................................................. \n86 \nLine 636 – Federal foreign business income tax credit ... \n86 \nContinuity of unused federal foreign business \nincome tax credits ........................................................ \n87 \nCarryback or carryforward of unused credits ............. \n87 \nLines 638 and 639 – General tax reduction ......................  \n87 \nLine 640 – Federal logging tax credit ................................  \n87 \nLine 641 – Eligible Canadian bank deduction under \nsection 125.21 ...................................................................  \n87 \nLine 648 – Federal qualifying environmental trust tax \ncredit .................................................................................  \n87 \nLine 652 – Investment tax credit ........................................  \n88 \nAvailable-for-use rule .....................................................  \n88 \nInvestments and expenditures that qualify for an \nITC .................................................................................  \n88 \nActivities that qualify for an ITC on qualified \nproperty ........................................................................  \n88 \nScientific research and experimental development \n(SR&ED) qualified expenditure pool ........................  \n89 \nSR&ED investment tax credit and refund ....................  \n89 \nApprenticeship job creation tax credit ..........................  \n90 \nInvestment tax credit (ITC) for child care spaces ........  \n90 \nInvestment tax credit (ITC) claim ..................................  \n90 \nWhen to complete Schedule 31 ......................................  \n90 \nInvestment tax credit refund ..........................................  \n91 \nPart I tax payable .................................................................  \n91 \n \nPart I tax \nLine 550 – Base amount of Part I tax \nThe basic rate of Part I tax is 38% of taxable income.

Amounts added to the NERDTOH pool will be \nrefunded when taxable dividends (other than eligible \ndividends) are paid to shareholders (at a rate of 38 1/3% of \nsuch dividends paid). \nA CCPC (or a substantive CCPC to which the additional tax \napplies) with investment income has to calculate this \nadditional tax on page 8 and enter the amount on line 604. \nReferences \nSection 123.3 \nSubsections 129(1) and 129(4) \nLine 608 – Federal tax abatement \nThe federal tax abatement is equal to 10% of taxable income \nearned in the year in a Canadian province or territory. \nThe federal tax abatement reduces Part I tax payable. \nIncome earned outside Canada is not eligible for the federal \ntax abatement. \nOn line 608, enter the amount of federal tax abatement. \nReference \nSection 124 \nLine 616 – Manufacturing and processing \nprofits deduction and zero-emission \ntechnology manufacturing deduction \nCorporations that derive at least 10% of their gross revenue \nfor the year from manufacturing or processing goods in \nCanada for sale or lease can claim the manufacturing and \nprocessing profits deduction (MPPD). The MPPD reduces \nPart I tax otherwise payable. \nThe MPPD applies to the part of taxable income that \nrepresents Canadian manufacturing and processing profits. \nCalculate the MPPD at the rate of 13% on income that is not \neligible for the small business deduction (SBD). \nA temporary measure reduces the corporate tax rates for \nmanufacturers of qualified zero-emission technology for tax \nyears starting after 2021. \nIncome that would otherwise be subject to the 15% general \ncorporate rate is now taxed at a 7.5% rate. Income that \nwould otherwise be taxed at the 9% small-business rate is \nnow taxed at a 4.5% rate. \nThe temporary measure has been extended by three years. \nThe reduced rates will be gradually phased out starting in \ntax years that begin in 2032 and fully phased out for tax \nyears that begin after 2034, as follows: \nReduced tax rates for zero-emission technology \nTax year start \nSmall business rate \nOther rate \n2022 to 2031 \n4.5% \n7.5% \n2032 \n5.625% \n9.375% \n2033 \n6.75% \n11.25% \n2034 \n7.875% \n13.125% \n2035 and later \n9% \n15% \nAt least 10% of the corporation’s gross revenue from all \nactive businesses carried on in Canada must be derived \nfrom eligible activities. Eligible activities include things \nsuch as: \n■ manufacturing of energy conversion equipment (for \nexample, solar, wind, water, and geothermal equipment) \n■ manufacturing of air-source heat pumps used for space \nor water heating \n■ most manufacturing activities around zero-emission \nvehicles (for example, manufacturing of vehicles, \nbatteries and charging stations) \n■ for tax years starting after 2023, the following nuclear \nmanufacturing and processing activities: \n– manufacturing of nuclear energy equipment \n– processing or recycling of nuclear fuels and heavy \nwater \n– manufacturing of nuclear fuel rods \nUse Schedule 27, Calculation of Canadian Manufacturing and \nProcessing Profits Deduction, to calculate the manufacturing \nand processing profits deduction and the zero-emission \ntechnology manufacturing deduction. \nThere are two ways to calculate Canadian manufacturing \nand processing profits: a simplified method for small \nmanufacturing corporations, and a basic labour and capital \nemployed in qualified activities formula for other \ncorporations. These methods are outlined in parts 1 and 2 \nof Schedule 27. \nNote \nThe new reduced tax rate for zero-emission technology \napplies only to the corporation’s zero-emission \ntechnology manufacturing profits, defined in \nsubsection 125.2(2) of the Act. These profits are equal to \nthe corporation’s adjusted business income multiplied \nby the proportion of its total labour and capital cost that \nare used in zero emission technology manufacturing. \nSmall manufacturing corporations only have to complete \nPart 1 of Schedule 27 and are entitled to calculate the MPPD \non their entire adjusted business income. Essentially, a \ncorporation’s adjusted business income is its income from \nan active business it carried on in Canada that is more than \nits losses from similar businesses. If the corporation is \ninvolved in resource activities, it has to reduce the adjusted \nbusiness income by its net resource income, its refund \ninterest, and part of its prescribed resource loss. \nSchedule 27 shows how to calculate the adjusted business \nincome. \nTo qualify as a small manufacturing corporation, you have \nto meet all of the following requirements: \n■ the activities during the year were mainly manufacturing \nor processing \n■ the active business income and that of any associated \nCanadian corporations was not more than $200,000 \n■ you were not engaged in any activities specifically \nexcluded from manufacturing and processing, as defined \nin subsection 125.1(3), such as farming, fishing, logging, \nconstruction, operating an oil or gas well or extracting\n\n\n\n=== Page 86 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n86\npetroleum or natural gas, extracting minerals, processing \nore, producing industrial minerals, and others \n■ you did not carry on any active business outside Canada \nat any time during the year \nCorporations that do not qualify as small manufacturing \ncorporations have to complete Part 2 of Schedule 27.

The limit begins to decrease when this \ncapital reaches $10 million and becomes nil at $50 million \nand higher. \nThe Government announced that, for tax years that begin \non or after December 16, 2024: \n■ the expenditure limit would increase from $3 million to \n$4.5 million \n■ the phase-out thresholds would increase from \n$10 million and $50 million, to $15 million and \n$75 million, respectively. CCPCs would have the option \nto have their annual expenditure limit determined based \non gross revenue instead of taxable capital \n■ the enhanced refundable SR&ED credit would be \nextended to Canadian public corporations. However, \nunlike CCPCs: \n– the $15 million and $75 million phase-out thresholds \nwould be based on the corporation’s gross revenue \nover the prior three years instead of its taxable capital \nfor the preceding year \n– qualifying expenditures in excess of an eligible \nCanadian public corporation’s annual expenditure \nlimit would not be eligible for a partially refundable \nSR&ED ITC \nFor property acquired after December 15, 2024 (or lease \ncosts first becoming payable after that date) the pre-2014 \neligibility of capital expenditures would be reinstated to \nboth the SR&ED income deduction and the SR&ED ITC. \nQualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC would \nbe entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate \nof 40% on their capital expenditures. \nIf the corporation is associated with one or more CCPCs, \nyou have to allocate the expenditure limit among the \nassociated CCPCs on Schedule 49, Agreement Among \nAssociated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate \nthe Expenditure Limit. See page 34 for details about \nSchedule 49. \nCCPCs that do not meet the definition of qualifying \ncorporation can earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on \nqualified SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure \nlimit. This ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the \nyear to offset Part I tax. The ITC earned on SR&ED \nexpenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is earned at \nthe rate of 15% and it is not refundable. \nA qualifying corporation is a CCPC whose taxable income \nfor the previous tax year before the application of the \nspecified future tax consequences plus the taxable incomes \nof all associated corporations before the application of the \nspecified future tax consequences (for tax years ending in \nthe same calendar year as the corporation’s previous tax \nyear) is not more than the total of the qualifying income \nlimits of the corporation and the associated corporations for \nthose previous years. \nThe qualifying income limit is $500,000. It begins to \ndecrease when the total taxable capital employed in Canada \nof the corporation and its associated corporations for the \nprevious tax year reaches $10 million and becomes nil at \n$50 million. \nCCPCs that meet the definition of qualifying corporation \ncan also earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified \nSR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure limit. This \nITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the year to offset \nPart I tax. For qualifying corporations, the ITC earned on \nSR&ED expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is \nearned at the rate of 15%, of which 40% is also refundable. \nCorporations may be associated because the same group of \npersons controls them, but the members of this group do \nnot act together and have no other connection to each other. \nCCPCs that are associated only because of the above \ndefinition of a group will not be considered associated for \nthe following calculations: \n■ the refundable ITC on eligible SR&ED expenditures \n■ calculating the expenditure limit \n■ allocating the expenditure limit\n\n\n\n=== Page 90 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n90\nFor this exception to apply, one of the corporations must \nhave at least one shareholder who is not common to both \ncorporations. \nReferences \nSection 127.1 \nSubsections 127(5) to 127(12) and 248(1) \nRegulations 2902 and 4600 \nApprenticeship job creation tax credit \nA corporation can earn a non-refundable ITC equal to 10% \nof the eligible salaries and wages paid to eligible \napprentices employed in the business in the tax year to a \nmaximum credit of $2,000, per year, per apprentice. \nAn eligible apprentice is one who is working in a \nprescribed trade in the first 24 months of their \napprenticeship contract.

Eligible salaries or wages \ndo not include qualified expenditures incurred by the \ncorporation in a tax year, remuneration based on profits, \nbonuses, taxable benefits including stock options, and \ncertain unpaid remuneration. \nWhere two or more related employers employ an \napprentice, special rules apply to ensure that the $2,000 \nlimit is allocated to only one employer. \nAn unused credit can be carried back 3 years and carried \nforward 20 years. \nComplete parts 19 to 21 of Schedule 31 to calculate the \ncredit. \nInvestment tax credit (ITC) for child care spaces \nNote \nYou can no longer earn this credit. It was eliminated for \nexpenditures made after March 21, 2017, and so was the \ntransitional measure for eligible expenditures incurred \nbefore 2020 under a written agreement entered into \nbefore March 22, 2017. You can only carry forward the \nnon-refundable, unused, unexpired credit for 20 tax \nyears. \nTo claim the carryforward, complete parts 22 and 23 of \nSchedule 31. \nThe credit will be added to the taxpayer’s tax otherwise \npayable under Part I of the Act if, at any time within the \n60 months of the day on which the taxpayer acquired the \nproperty: \n■ the new child care space is no longer available, or \n■ property that was an eligible expenditure for this credit is \nsold or leased to another person or converted to another \nuse \nFor more information on the recapture, see Line 602 on \npage 83. \nInvestment tax credit (ITC) claim \nYou can deduct the full amount of ITC against federal Part I \ntax payable.

area of your return, \nsummarize the amounts of federal and provincial or \nterritorial tax payable, as well as the credits and refunds \nclaimed to reduce total tax payable. \nFederal tax \nLine 700 – Part I tax payable \nOn line 700, enter the amount of Part I tax payable that you \ndetermined at amount N of page 8. \nLine 705 – Part II.2 tax payable \nFor transactions that occur after 2023, a 2% tax on \nrepurchases of equity applies (subject to certain exceptions) \non the net value of all equity repurchases during the year \nby: \n■ a corporation resident in Canada (other than a mutual \nfund corporation) whose shares are listed on a \ndesignated stock exchange at any time in the tax year \n■ a trust whose units are listed on a designated stock \nexchange at any time in the tax year and that is one of the \nfollowing: \n– a real estate investment trust \n– a specified investment flow-through (SIFT) trust \n■ a partnership where the partnership unit is listed on a \ndesignated stock exchange at any time in the tax year and \nthat is a SIFT partnership \n■ publicly traded entities that would be SIFT trusts or SIFT \npartnerships if their assets were located in Canada \nThe tax does not apply to an entity described above in a tax \nyear if the total fair market value of equity that is \nredeemed, acquired, or cancelled in that tax year (prorated \nfor short tax years) is less than $1 million. \nUse Schedule 56, Part II.2 Tax on repurchases of equity, to \ncalculate any Part II.2 tax payable and file it with your \nT2 return. A penalty applies for late filing of Schedule 56 in \naddition to the penalty applicable to late filing of the \nT2 Return. \nOn line 705, enter the amount of Part II.2 tax payable that \nyou determined at amount G of Schedule 56. \nLine 710 – Part III.1 tax payable \nA corporation that designates dividends as eligible \ndividends that exceed its capacity to pay such dividends is \nsubject to Part III.1 tax. The tax is equal to 20% of the \nexcessive eligible dividend designation. \nUse Schedule 55, Part III.1 Tax on Excessive Eligible Dividend \nDesignations, to calculate any Part III.1 tax payable and file \nit with your T2 return. \nNote \nEvery corporation resident in Canada that pays a taxable \ndividend in the year, other than a capital gains dividend, \nmust file this schedule. \nIn the case where an excessive eligible dividend \ndesignation is determined to be part of a tax avoidance \nscheme, the 20% tax plus an additional 10% tax will apply \nto the whole dividend designation. \nEligible dividend \nAn eligible dividend is any taxable dividend paid to a \nresident of Canada by a Canadian corporation that is \ndesignated by that corporation to be an eligible dividend. \nThe corporation does the designation by notifying, in \nwriting, each person or partnership at the time it pays them \nthe dividend. For more information about the notification \nguidelines, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends and \nselect “Designation of eligible dividends.” \nA corporation is allowed to designate a portion of a taxable \ndividend (rather than the whole amount) to be an eligible \ndividend. Late designations are allowed, if they are made \nwithin three years, or in some situations, six years, after the \nday on which the designation was first required to be made \nand, in the opinion of the minister, it is just and equitable to \ndo so (including to affected shareholders) in the \ncircumstances. The designation is deemed to have been \nmade on the day the designation was required to be made. \nA corporation’s capacity to pay eligible dividends depends \nmostly on its status. \nGeneral rate income pool (GRIP) \nA CCPC or a deposit insurance corporation may pay \neligible dividends to the extent of its GRIP—a balance \ngenerally reflecting taxable income that has not benefited \nfrom the small business deduction or any other special tax \nrate—without incurring Part III.1 tax. The GRIP is \ncalculated at the end of the tax year. However, a \ncorporation can pay eligible dividends over the course of \nthe year as long as, at the end of the year, the eligible \ndividends paid do not exceed its GRIP. \nUse Schedule 53, General Rate Income Pool (GRIP) \nCalculation, to determine the GRIP and file it with your \nT2 return. You should file this schedule if you paid an \neligible dividend in the tax year, or if your GRIP balance \nchanged, to ensure that the GRIP balance on CRA’s records \nis correct. \nYou can view GRIP balances using the “View return \nbalances” service through: \n■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account, if you are the business owner \n■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if \nyou are an authorized representative or employee \nLow rate income pool (LRIP) \nA corporation resident in Canada that is neither a CCPC \nnor a deposit insurance corporation can pay eligible \ndividends in any amount unless it has an LRIP. \nNote \nFor tax years starting after April 6, 2022, the investment \nincome earned by substantive CCPCs will be added to \ntheir LRIP so that distributions of such income will not \nentitle the shareholders to the enhanced dividend tax \ncredit.\n\n\n\n=== Page 95 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n95\nThe LRIP is generally made up of taxable income that has \nbenefited from certain preferential tax rates. The \ncorporation has to reduce its LRIP to zero by paying out \nordinary dividends before it can pay an eligible dividend, \nor it will be subject to Part III.1 tax. The LRIP must be \ncalculated at the time a dividend is paid or received or any \nother event occurs affecting the LRIP balance in the year. \nUse Schedule 54, Low Rate Income Pool (LRIP) Calculation, to \ndetermine the LRIP, throughout the year. File the \ncompleted schedule with your T2 return. All other \ncalculations including the worksheets should be kept with \nyour records in case the CRA asks for them at a later date. \nElection not to be a Canadian-controlled private \ncorporation \nA CCPC can elect not to be a CCPC for purposes of the \neligible dividend treatment. If it so elects, it is deemed not \nto be a CCPC for the tax year in which it makes the election \nand all later tax years, until it revokes the election. The \nCCPC will lose its entitlement to the small business \ndeduction. However, no other benefits of CCPC status will \nbe affected. \nA corporation that revokes an election will become a CCPC \nagain for the tax year that follows the tax year in which the \nrevocation is made. \nUse Form T2002, Election, or Revocation of an Election, not to \nBe a Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation, to make or to \nrevoke an election previously made, and file it by the due \ndate of the T2 return. The CRA will not accept an election \nor revocation of an election after the filing due date. \nNote \nA corporation that has previously revoked an election \nmust get written consent from the CRA to make or \nrevoke another election. \nElection to treat excessive eligible dividend \ndesignations as ordinary dividends \nCorporations that make excessive eligible dividend \ndesignations may be allowed to elect to treat the excessive \namounts paid as ordinary dividends. In order to do so, the \ncorporation must have the concurrence of its shareholders \nwho received, or were entitled to receive, the dividend and \nwhose addresses are known to the corporation. For more \ninformation, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends and \nselect “Election to treat excessive eligible dividend \ndesignations as ordinary dividends.” \nCorporations cannot elect to treat excessive eligible \ndividend designations that are subject to the 30% Part III.1 \ntax as ordinary dividends. \nReferences \nSections 185.1 and 185.2 \nSubsections 89(11) to (14) \nLine 712 – Part IV tax payable \nUse Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable \nDividends Paid, and Part IV Tax Calculation, to calculate \nPart IV tax payable on taxable dividends you received. \nDividends subject to Part IV tax \nThe following types of dividends are subject to Part IV tax: \n■ taxable dividends from corporations that are deductible \nunder section 112 when you calculate taxable income \n■ taxable dividends from foreign affiliates that are \ndeductible under paragraphs 113(1)(a), (a.1) (b), or (d), or \nsubsection 113(2) when you calculate taxable income \nNote \nFor details about dividends received after 2023 by \nfinancial institutions on shares that are mark-to-market \nproperty, see Line 320 on page 72. \nTaxable dividends received are only subject to Part IV tax \nif the corporation receives them while it is a private or \nsubject corporation. Taxable dividends received from a \nnon-connected corporation are subject to Part IV tax at a \nrate of 38 1/3%. \nTaxable dividends received from a connected corporation \nare subject to Part IV tax only when paying the dividends \ngenerates a dividend refund for the payer corporation. \nDefinitions \nPrivate corporation \nA private corporation is a corporation that is: \n■ resident in Canada \n■ not a public corporation \n■ not controlled by one or more public corporations \n(other than a prescribed venture capital corporation) \n■ not controlled by one or more prescribed federal Crown \ncorporations \n■ not controlled by any combination of prescribed federal \nCrown corporations and public corporations \nReference \nSubsection 89(1) \nSubject corporation \nA subject corporation is a corporation, other than a private \ncorporation, that is resident in Canada and is controlled by \nor for the benefit of either an individual other than a trust, \nor a related group of individuals other than trusts. \nReference \nSubsection 186(3) \nConnected corporation \nA payer corporation is connected to the corporation that \nreceives the dividends (the recipient) if the recipient \ncontrols the payer corporation. The payer and recipient \ncorporations are also connected when both of the following \napply: \n■ the recipient owns more than 10% of the issued share \ncapital (with full voting rights) of the payer corporation \n■ the recipient owns shares of the capital stock of the payer \ncorporation with a fair market value of more than 10% of \nthe fair market value of all the issued share capital of the \npayer corporation \nYou determine control of the corporation by considering \nthe actual ownership of shares, without taking into account \nany rights referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b). \nFor purposes of Part IV tax, a payer corporation is \ncontrolled by a recipient corporation if more than 50% of\n\n\n\n=== Page 96 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n96\nthe payer’s issued share capital (having full voting rights) \nbelongs to the recipient, to persons with whom the \nrecipient does not deal at arm’s length, or to any \ncombination of these persons. \nReferences \nSubsections 186(2) and (4) \nExempt corporations \nThe following types of corporations are exempt from \nPart IV tax: \nA. a corporation that was bankrupt at any time during the \nyear \nB. a corporation that, throughout the year, was one of the \nfollowing: \n– a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital \ncorporation \n– a prescribed investment contract corporation \n– an insurance corporation \n– a corporation licensed as a trustee \n– a bank \n– a registered securities dealer that was, throughout the \nyear, a member of a designated stock exchange in \nCanada \nReference \nSection 186.1 \nExempt dividends \nA corporation that is a prescribed venture capital \ncorporation throughout the year does not have to pay \nPart IV tax on dividends it received from a prescribed \nqualifying corporation. \nReferences \nSection 186.2 \nRegulation 6704 \nDividends not taxable \nAny dividends that a corporation received from a capital \ndividend account are not taxable, as long as the payer \ncorporation made an election under section 83. Therefore, if \nthese non-taxable dividends are included as income, they \nshould be deducted as an adjustment on Schedule 1. \nParts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3 \nIn the following section you will find details on Parts 1 \nand 2 of Schedule 3. Parts 3 and 4 are explained on page 82. \nPart 1 – Dividends received in the tax year \nComplete Part 1 to identify dividends, both taxable and \nnon-taxable, received during the tax year and to calculate \nPart IV tax before deductions. Public corporations (other \nthan subject corporations) do not need to calculate Part IV \ntax. \nNote \nIf more than one corporation paid dividends, you have \nto do a separate calculation for each payer corporation. If \nyour corporation’s tax year-end is different than that of \nthe payer corporation, dividends could have been \nreceived from more than one tax year of the payer \ncorporation. If so, use a separate line to provide the \ninformation according to each tax year of the payer \ncorporation. \nOn line 320 of the return, enter the amount of taxable \ndividends deductible from taxable income under \nsection 112, subsections 113(2) and 138(6), and \nparagraphs 113(1)(a), (a.1), (b), or (d). \nPart 2 – Calculation of Part IV tax payable \nPart IV tax otherwise payable on a dividend is reduced by \nany amount of Part IV.1 tax payable on the same dividend. \nSee below for details. \nYou can reduce the amount of dividends subject to Part IV \ntax by using non-capital losses and farm losses incurred in \nthe tax year or carried forward from previous years. \nPart 2 also allows the calculation of Part IV tax payable for \ntaxable dividends received from connected corporations \nand eligible dividends received from non-connected \ncorporations. \nOn line 712 of the return, enter the amount of Part IV tax \npayable on taxable dividends received. \nReferences \nIT-269, Part IV Tax on Taxable Dividends Received by a Private Corporation or a \nSubject Corporation \nSubsection 129(4) \nLine 716 – Part IV.1 tax payable \nComplete Schedule 43, Calculation of Parts IV.1 and VI.1 \nTaxes, to calculate Part IV.1 tax payable. \nPart 4 of Schedule 43 – Calculation of Part IV.1 tax \npayable \nPart 4 gives details on how to calculate Part IV.1 tax. \nPublic corporations and certain other corporations may be \nsubject to the 10% Part IV.1 tax on dividends they receive \non taxable preferred shares. A restricted financial \ninstitution is also subject to tax on dividends received \non taxable restricted financial institution shares \n(see subsection 248(1) for definitions of these terms). \nThe issuer of taxable preferred shares can elect to pay \na 40% rather than a 25% tax under Part VI.1 on dividends \non taxable preferred shares when they complete Part 3 of \nthis schedule. This election exempts the holder of these \nshares from the 10% tax under Part IV.1. No other form \nneeds to be filed to elect. For details, see Line 724 on \npage 97. \nExcepted dividends, which are defined in section 187.1, \nare not subject to Part IV.1 tax. For example, an excepted \ndividend is one the corporation receives on a share of \nanother corporation in which the corporation had a \nsubstantial interest at the time it received the dividend. \nPart 4 of the schedule also allows the calculation of Part IV \ntax reduction when there is Part IV.1 tax payable on the \nsame dividend. \nThe Part IV tax reduction is equal to: \n■ 10% of the dividend, if the dividend is received from a \nnon-connected corporation \n■ 30% of the Part IV tax payable, if the dividend is received \nfrom a connected corporation\n\n\n\n=== Page 97 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n97\nOn line 716, enter the amount of Part IV.1 tax payable that \nyou calculated on line 340 of Schedule 43. \nReferences \nSections 187.1 to 187.6 \nSubsections 186(1.1) and 191.2(1) \nLine 720 – Part VI tax payable \nYou have to complete Schedule 38, Part VI Tax on Capital of \nFinancial Institutions, to calculate Part VI tax. \nPart VI levies a tax on a financial institution’s taxable \ncapital employed in Canada. Part VI tax is 1.25% of the \ntaxable capital employed in Canada that is more than the \n$1 billion capital deduction for the year. \nIf the corporation is a member of a related group, you have \nto allocate the capital deduction among the members. \nUse Schedule 39, Agreement Among Related Financial \nInstitutions – Part VI Tax, to allocate the capital deduction. \nFile this agreement with your return. \nNote \nOnly one of the associated or related corporations needs \nto file Schedule 39 for a calendar year. However, if \nSchedule 39 is not already on file when the CRA assesses \nany of the returns for a tax year ending in the calendar \nyear of the agreement, it will ask for one. \nUnder subsection 190.1(3), you can deduct Part I tax \npayable for the year from Part VI tax payable. This is called \nthe Part I tax credit. You can deduct any unused Part I tax \ncredits from Part VI tax in any of the three previous and \nseven following tax years. \nTo calculate the balance of unused Part I tax credits and to \ncarry back this credit, you can use Schedule 42, Calculation \nof Unused Part I Tax Credit. \nFinancial institutions include banks, trust companies, life \ninsurance corporations, certain holding corporations, and \ncorporations that accept deposits and carry on the business \nof lending money on the security of real property or \nimmovables, or investing in indebtedness on the security of \nmortgages on real property or of hypothecs on immovables. \nFile Schedule 38 with your return if you have Part VI tax \npayable, or would have, if not for the deduction of a Part I \ntax credit. \nOn line 720, enter the amount of Part VI tax payable that \nyou calculated on line 890 of Schedule 38. \nReferences \nSections 190, 190.1, and 190.11 to 190.15 \nLine 724 – Part VI.1 tax payable \nComplete the following schedules if required: \n■ Schedule 43, Calculation of Parts IV.1 and VI.1 Taxes \n■ Schedule 45, Agreement Respecting Liability for \nPart VI.1 Tax \nSee the following headings for more details \nPart 1 of Schedule 43 – Calculation of dividend \nallowance \nCalculate the dividend allowance on Part 1 of Schedule 43. \nGenerally, the first $500,000 of dividends paid in the year \non taxable preferred shares is exempt from Part VI.1 tax \nliability. This basic annual exemption is called the dividend \nallowance. \nHowever, the $500,000 dividend allowance is reduced if \nyou paid more than $1 million of dividends on taxable \npreferred shares in the previous year. \nPart 2 of Schedule 43 – Agreement among associated \ncorporations to allocate the dividend allowance \nIf you are a member of an associated group, you have to \nallocate the dividend allowance between the members. \nPart 2 provides an area for this allocation. \nPart 3 of Schedule 43 – Calculation of Part VI.1 tax \npayable \nComplete Part 3 of Schedule 43 to calculate Part VI.1 tax. \nPart VI.1 tax is levied on dividends (other than certain \nexcluded dividends) you paid on short-term preferred \nshares and taxable preferred shares. \nYou are subject to a 40% tax on dividends you paid on \nshort-term preferred shares that are more than the annual \ndividend allowance. \nYou are subject to a tax of 25% or 40% on dividends you \npaid on taxable preferred shares (other than short-term \npreferred shares) that are more than any remaining \ndividend allowance. Choosing the 40% rate will exempt the \nholder of these shares from the 10% tax under Part IV.1. \nThis rate would apply to all future dividends paid on that \nclass or series of shares. \nSee subsection 248(1) for definitions of the terms short-term \npreferred shares and taxable preferred shares. \nSchedule 45, Agreement Respecting Liability for \nPart VI.1 Tax \nComplete Schedule 45 to certify the transfer of Part VI.1 tax \nliability and send it to the CRA with Schedule 43. \nA corporation (the transferor) can transfer all or part of its \nPart VI.1 tax liability to another corporation (the transferee), \nif the corporations were related throughout the following \ntax years: \n■ the transferor’s tax year for which it owes Part VI.1 tax \n■ the transferee’s tax year that ends on or before the end of \nthe above-mentioned transferor’s tax year \nYou can deduct Part VI.1 tax payable from income. See \npage 73 for more information. Any Part VI.1 tax that is left \nover after the taxable income is reduced to zero is part of \nthe non-capital loss for the year.

Corporations that earn income in these \nprovinces have to file separate provincial corporation \nincome tax returns. \nAll other provinces and territories legislate their \ncorporation income tax provisions, but the CRA \nadministers them. These provinces and territories do not \ncharge income tax on the taxable income of corporations \nthat are exempt from tax under section 149. \nIf the corporation has a permanent establishment in any \nprovince or territory other than Quebec or Alberta, you \nhave to calculate provincial and/or territorial income taxes \nand credits, as well as federal income taxes and credits, on \nthe return. \nNote \nUnless otherwise specified in the legislation, the credits \nare considered government assistance and must be \nincluded in income in the tax year they are received. \nReference \nParagraph 12(1)(x) \nPermanent establishment \nA permanent establishment in a province or territory is \nusually a fixed place of business of the corporation, which \nincludes an office, branch, oil well, farm, timberland, \nfactory, workshop, warehouse, or mine. Each corporate \npartner in a partnership has a permanent establishment \nwhere the partnership has a fixed place of business. If the \ncorporation does not have a fixed place of business, the \ncorporation’s permanent establishment is the principal \nplace in which the corporation’s business is conducted. \nEach member of a partnership has a permanent \nestablishment in the province or territory where the \npartnership has a permanent establishment. This applies to \nboth general and limited partners. For example, where a \ncorporation or its partnership uses substantial machinery or \nequipment in a particular place at any time in a tax year, it \nis deemed to have a permanent establishment in that place. \nReview the locations in which your activities and \ntransactions occur to ensure all permanent establishments \nare properly identified. \nIf the corporation carries on business, including partnership \nbusiness, through an employee or an agent established in a \nparticular place, it is considered to have a permanent \nestablishment in that place if the employee or agent: \n■ has general authority to contract for the corporation, or \n■ has a stock of merchandise owned by the corporation \nfrom which the employee or agent regularly fills orders \nreceived \nA corporation that would not otherwise have any \npermanent establishment in a province or territory and/or \na jurisdiction outside of Canada is deemed to have a \npermanent establishment at the place designated in its \nincorporation documents or bylaws as its head office or \nregistered office. So, whether or not the corporation carries \non a business in a province or territory, it is entitled to the \n10% federal abatement, but subject to provincial or \nterritorial taxation. \nSee Regulation 400(2) for a complete definition of \npermanent establishment. \nReferences \nRegulation 400(2) \nIT-177, Permanent Establishment of a Corporation in a Province \nLine 750 – Provincial or territorial jurisdiction \nOn line 750, give the name of the province or territory \nwhere you earned your income. Usually, this is where the \ncorporation has its permanent establishment. \nIf you earned income in more than one province or \nterritory, write “multiple” on line 750 and file Schedule 5,\n\n\n\n=== Page 99 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n99\nTax Calculation Supplementary – Corporations, with your \nreturn.

Complete columns A to F for each \nprovince or territory in which you had a permanent \nestablishment in the tax year. If there is no taxable income, \nyou only have to complete columns A, B and D. \nNote \nThis also applies to corporations with permanent \nestablishments in Quebec or Alberta. \nThe CRA assesses provincial or territorial income taxes on \nthe amount of taxable income allocated to each province or \nterritory. For details on how to allocate taxable income, see \nRegulation 402 and Income Tax Folio S4-F3-C2, Provincial \nIncome Allocation. \nSpecial rules for establishing a corporation’s gross revenue \nand salaries and wages attributable to a jurisdiction are \nprovided in cases where the corporation is a member of a \npartnership and the partnership had permanent \nestablishments in more than one jurisdiction. See \nGuide T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return \n(T5013 Forms), and prescribed Form T5013 SCH 5, Allocation \nof Salaries and Wages, and Gross Revenue for Multiple \nJurisdictions – Schedule 5. \nWhether or not the partnership filed a T5013 and related \nschedules, the partner corporations must report their \npermanent establishments and allocable revenue and \nsalaries and wages on their own Schedule 5, inclusive of \ntheir partnership allocations. If a partner has a 50% share of \npartnership income it must include 50% of the gross \nrevenue from T5013 SCH 5 in its T2 SCH 5 gross revenue. \nSalaries and wages of the partnership should also be \nreported on the T2 SCH 5 in the same proportions. \nGenerally, to allocate taxable income to each province or \nterritory, you have to use a formula based on gross \nrevenue, and salaries and wages. See Part 1 of Schedule 5 \nfor details. \nYou will find the general rules on how to allocate gross \nrevenue in Regulation 402. \nDo not include any of the following amounts in gross \nrevenue: \n■ interest on bonds, debentures, or mortgages \n■ dividends on shares of capital stock \n■ rents or royalties from property that are not part of the \nprincipal business operations \nAllocate gross salaries and wages paid in the year to the \npermanent establishment in which those salaries and wages \nwere paid only to the extent they were paid to employees of \nthe permanent establishment (the permanent establishment \nis not necessarily the permanent establishment in which \nthose salaries and wages were paid). Do not include in \ngross salaries and wages any commissions paid to a person \nwho is not an employee, unless that person renders services \nthat would normally be performed by an employee of the \ncorporation. The allocation of salaries paid through a \ncentral paymaster is subject to the deeming rules under \nRegulation 402.1. \nSee Regulations 403 to 413 for details on special methods \nfor allocating taxable income for the following types of \nbusinesses: \n■ insurance corporations (Regulation 403) \n■ banks (Regulation 404) \n■ federal credit unions (Regulation 404.1) \n■ trust and loan corporations (Regulation 405) \n■ railway corporations (Regulation 406) \n■ airline corporations (Regulation 407) \n■ grain elevator operators (Regulation 408)\n\n\n\n=== Page 100 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n100 \n■ bus and truck operators (Regulation 409) \n■ ship operators (Regulation 410) \n■ pipeline operators (Regulation 411) \n■ divided businesses (Regulation 412) \n■ non-resident corporations (Regulation 413) \nIn field 100, enter the regulation number that applies to \nattribute the taxable income. \nReference \nRegulations 400 to 413.1 \nPart 2 of Schedule 5 – Provincial and territorial tax \npayable, tax credits, and rebates \nComplete Part 2 of Schedule 5 if one of the following \napplies: \n■ there is provincial or territorial tax (and a permanent \nestablishment in more than one province or territory) \n■ there is a claim for provincial or territorial tax credits or \nrebates \n■ there is a claim for provincial or territorial refundable tax \ncredits \nNote \nCorporations with a permanent establishment in Quebec \nor Alberta must complete the appropriate provincial \ncorporation returns and schedules to report provincial \ntax and claim provincial credits and rebates. \nCorporations with a permanent establishment in Ontario \nmust also complete Part 2 of Schedule 5 if one of the \nthree previous or five following conditions applies. The \ncorporation: \n■ is claiming the Ontario small business deduction \n■ is claiming the Ontario credit union reduction \n■ has an addition to Ontario basic income tax (such as a \ntransitional tax debit) \n■ has Ontario corporate minimum tax payable \n■ has Ontario special additional tax on life insurance \ncorporations payable \nCorporations must also complete Part 2 of Schedule 5 if \nthey have Newfoundland and Labrador capital tax on \nfinancial institutions payable or Nova Scotia financial \ninstitutions capital tax payable. \nOn line 255 of Schedule 5, enter the net amount of \nprovincial and territorial tax payable or the net amount of \nrefundable credits. When the result is positive, enter the net \nprovincial or territorial tax payable on line 760 of the \nreturn. When the result is negative, enter the refundable \nprovincial or territorial tax credit on line 812 of the return. \nAttach to your return any forms you completed to claim \nprovincial or territorial credits or rebates. \nIn the following sections, you will find information about \nprovincial and territorial tax rates, foreign tax credits, and \ndetails on the provincial and territorial credits and rebates. \nDual rates of provincial and territorial \nincome tax \nGenerally, provinces and territories have two rates of \nincome tax: the lower rate and the higher rate. \nThe lower rate applies to the income eligible for the federal \nsmall business deduction. One component of the small \nbusiness deduction is the business limit. Some provinces or \nterritories choose to use the federal business limit. Others \nestablish their own business limit. \nThe higher rate applies to all other income. For detailed \ninformation on the income eligible for each rate and the \nrates that apply to each province and territory, see the \nsections that follow in this chapter or go to canada.ca/en \n/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics \n/corporations/corporation-tax-rates. \nExample 1 \nCorp X earned all its income in 2024 from its permanent \nestablishment in Newfoundland and Labrador. Corp X \nclaimed the small business deduction when it calculated its \nfederal tax payable. The income from active business \ncarried on in Canada was $78,000. \nThe Newfoundland and Labrador lower rate of tax is 2.5%. \nThe higher rate of tax is 15%. \nCorp X calculates its Newfoundland and Labrador tax \npayable as follows: \nTaxable income \n$90,000 \nSubtract amount taxed at lower rate: \nLeast of lines 400, 405, 410, and 428 in the  \nfederal small business deduction calculation  \n(from the T2 return) \n$78,000 \nAmount taxed at higher rate \n$12,000 \nTaxes payable at the lower rate: \n$78,000 × 2.5% =  \n \n$ 1,950 \nTaxes payable at the higher rate: \n$12,000 × 15% =  \n \n$ 1,800 \nNewfoundland and Labrador tax payable \n$ 3,750 \n \nWhen you allocate taxable income to more than one \nprovince or territory, you also have to allocate \nproportionally any income eligible for the federal small \nbusiness deduction. \n \nExample 2 \nCorp Y has permanent establishments in both \nNewfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut. Its tax year \nruns from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. \nCorp Y claimed the small business deduction when it \ncalculated its federal tax payable. \nThe lower rate of tax for Newfoundland and Labrador \nis 2.5%, and the higher rate of tax is 15%. \nTo calculate its Newfoundland and Labrador income tax, \nCorp Y does the following calculations:\n\n\n\n=== Page 101 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n101 \nTaxable income allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador \n(from Schedule 5) \n$60,000 \nTaxable income allocated to Nunavut (from Schedule 5)\n \n$30,000 \nTotal taxable income earned in Canada \n$90,000 \nLeast of lines 400, 405, 410, and 428 in the  \nfederal small business deduction calculation  \n(from the T2 return) \n$78,000 \nIncome eligible for the federal small business \ndeduction attributed to Newfoundland and Labrador: \n$60,000 × $78,000 = \n \n$52,000 \n$90,000 \nTaxable income earned in  \nNewfoundland and Labrador \n$60,000 \nSubtract: Income eligible for the federal small \nbusiness deduction attributed to Newfoundland  \nand Labrador \n$52,000 \nAmount taxed at higher rate \n$ 8,000 \nTaxes payable at higher rate: \n$8,000 × 15% = \n \n \n$ 1,200 \nTaxes payable at lower rate: \n$52,000 × 2.5% =  \n \n$ 1,300 \nNewfoundland and Labrador tax payable \n$ 2,500 \nTo calculate its Nunavut income tax payable, Corp Y would \nrepeat the same steps, using the rates that apply. \n \nOn the appropriate lines of Part 2 of Schedule 5, enter the \ngross amount of each provincial or territorial tax payable. \nProvincial or territorial foreign tax credits \nEvery province and territory allows a corporation to claim \na foreign tax credit for taxes it paid to another country on \nforeign non-business income. This credit reduces the \nprovincial tax otherwise payable. \nHowever, you cannot claim foreign tax credits for the \nprovinces of Quebec and Alberta on the federal return \nbecause these provinces collect their own income taxes. \nThe provincial or territorial foreign tax credit is available to \na corporation that meets all of the following criteria: \n■ it is resident in Canada throughout the tax year \n■ it has a permanent establishment in the province or \nterritory at any time in the tax year \n■ it has foreign investment income for the tax year \nFor Ontario, an authorized foreign bank is eligible for the \nforeign tax credit if it performed Canadian banking \nbusiness. \nYou can claim this credit only if the foreign non-business \nincome tax paid exceeds the federal foreign non-business \nincome tax credit deductible for the year. \nFor each province or territory for which you are claiming a \ncredit, you have to do a separate calculation. Also, if you \npaid tax to more than one foreign country you have to do a \nseparate calculation for each country. \nIf dual rates of corporation tax apply, use the higher rate \nwhen you calculate the foreign tax credit. For Ontario, use \nthe basic rate of tax. \nTo claim the foreign tax credit, complete Schedule 21, \nFederal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits \nand Federal Logging Tax Credit. \nNote \nIf the tax rate has changed during the tax year, you have \nto prorate the calculation in Part 9 of Schedule 21 using \nthe number of days in each period. For British Columbia, \nprorate the tax rate in each period, round off the \nprorated rates to the nearest one-thousandth of \none percent (= 0.001%), and add the rounded \npercentages for the periods before multiplying by the \nforeign non-business income. \nOn the appropriate lines of Part 2 of Schedule 5, enter the \napplicable provincial and territorial foreign tax credits. \nNewfoundland and Labrador \nThe lower rate of Newfoundland and Labrador income tax \nis 3%. This lower rate applies to taxable income earned in \nNewfoundland and Labrador that qualifies for the federal \nsmall business deduction. \nEffective January 1, 2024, the lower rate of income tax is \ndecreased from 3% to 2.5%. If the rate changes during the \ntax year, you have to base your calculation on the number \nof days in the year that each rate is in effect. \nThe higher rate of income tax is 15%. This higher rate \napplies to taxable income earned in Newfoundland and \nLabrador that does not qualify for the federal small \nbusiness deduction. \nThese rates also apply to taxable income earned in the \nNewfoundland and Labrador offshore area. \nYou can use Schedule 307, Newfoundland and Labrador \nCorporation Tax Calculation, to help you calculate the \nNewfoundland and Labrador tax before the credits are \napplied. You do not have to file it with your return. See the \nschedule for more details. \nOn line 200 and/or 205 of Schedule 5, enter the amount of \ntax calculated. \nNewfoundland and Labrador capital tax on financial \ninstitutions \nA provincial tax is levied on the taxable capital of a \ncorporation that is a financial institution that has a \npermanent establishment in Newfoundland and Labrador. \nThis tax applies to banks, as well as trust and loan \ncorporations. \nThe tax is equal to 6% of the amount by which the \ncorporation’s taxable capital employed in the province for \nthe year, including the offshore area, is more than its capital \ndeduction for the year. \nA capital deduction of $5 million is available to a \ncorporation if the total amount of the capital of the \ncorporation and any corporations in a related group, if any,\n\n\n\n=== Page 102 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n102 \nis $10 million or less. If the corporation is a member of a \nrelated group that includes another financial institution, the \ncorporation’s entitlement to the $5 million capital \ndeduction could be subject to allocation by the province \nunless the corporation files an agreement allocating the \ncapital deduction among the corporations in the related \ngroup. \nUse Schedule 306, Newfoundland and Labrador Capital Tax on \nFinancial Institutions – Agreement Among Related \nCorporations, to allocate the capital deduction. File this \nagreement with your return. \nCorporations that are liable to pay this tax have to file \nSchedule 305, Newfoundland and Labrador Capital Tax on \nFinancial Institutions. \nOn line 518 of Schedule 5, enter the provincial tax on \nfinancial institutions payable. \nA penalty applies to financial institutions that have to pay \nthis tax and do not file the required return on time. For \ndetails, see “Penalties” for large corporations on page 15. \nInstalment payment requirements for this tax are the same \nas for Part I tax. For details, see “Instalment due dates” on \npage 14. \nThe provincial capital tax cannot be reduced by any tax \ncredits. However, you can deduct the capital tax payable \nwhen calculating federal income for tax purposes. \nNewfoundland and Labrador political contribution \ntax credit \nYou can claim a tax credit on contributions made to \nregistered political parties, registered district associations, \nor registered non-affiliated candidates, as defined under the \nElections Act, 1991, of Newfoundland and Labrador. \nThe annual maximum credit is $500 and is calculated as \nfollows: \n■ 75% of the first $100 contributed \nplus \n■ 50% of the next $450 contributed \nplus \n■ 33 1/3% of the next $600 contributed \nYou do not have to file official receipts with your return. \nHowever, keep them in case the CRA asks for them later. \nThe CRA can accept photocopies only if the issuer certifies \nthem as true copies. \nOn line 891 of Schedule 5, enter the total amount of \nqualifying contributions, and on line 500, enter the amount \nof the credit you are claiming. \nNewfoundland and Labrador venture capital tax credit \nThe Newfoundland and Labrador government will issue a \ncertificate to corporations investing in qualifying venture \ncapital funds.

Businesses that incur qualified CCUS \nexpenditures after 2021 and before 2041 can claim the new \nrefundable CCUS ITC. \nThe credit rates for qualified CCUS expenditures are: \n■ 60% after 2021 (30% after 2030) for eligible capture \nequipment used in a direct air capture project \n■ 50% after 2021 (25% after 2030) for all other eligible \ncapture equipment \n■ 37.5% after 2021 (18.75% after 2030) for eligible \ntransportation, storage, and use equipment \nEffective November 28, 2023, businesses must elect to meet \ncertain labour requirements – prevailing wage \nrequirements and apprenticeship requirements. Otherwise, \nthe credit rate will be reduced by 10 percentage points. \nGenerally, you cannot claim the CCUS ITC if you claim one \nof the following credits for the same property: \n■ clean technology ITC \n■ clean hydrogen ITC \n■ clean technology manufacturing ITC \n■ ITCs in section 127 of the Income Tax Act (for example, \nthe Atlantic ITC) \n■ clean electricity ITC \nBusinesses may claim more than one clean economy ITC for \nthe same project, if the project includes different types of \neligible property. \nYou can claim the credit in the tax year you incurred the \nexpenses in, regardless of when the property becomes \navailable for use. \nEligible equipment is eligible for capital cost \nallowance (CCA) on a declining-balance basis in two new \nclasses: \n■ class 57 with an 8% CCA rate for capture, transportation, \nand storage equipment \n■ class 58 with a 20% CCA rate for use equipment \n(equipment required for using CO2 in industrial \nproduction)\n\n\n\n=== Page 136 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n136 \nYou must use the equipment as part of an eligible project. \nThese classes are eligible for enhanced first year \ndepreciation under the accelerated investment incentive. \nThere are two new CCA classes, 59 and 60, for certain \nexploration expenses and development expenses related to \nthe storage of captured carbon. \nCorporations must track and account for the capture and \nactual usage of CO2. As well, they may have to repay credit \namounts they were previously paid if the ineligible uses are \nmore than the quantities originally planned and in certain \nother circumstances. \nTo claim the credit, complete Schedule 78, Carbon Capture, \nUtilization, and Storage Investment Tax Credit, and file it by \nthe filing due date for the tax year you are entitled to claim \nthe credit for.

The credit is equal to 30% of the \ncapital cost of eligible clean technology property that is \nacquired and that becomes available for use after \nMarch 27, 2023, and before 2034. The rate will be reduced \nto 15% in 2034 and nil after 2034. \nEffective November 28, 2023, businesses must elect to meet \ncertain labour requirements – prevailing wage \nrequirements and apprenticeship requirements. Otherwise, \nthe credit rate will be reduced by 10 percentage points. \nExemptions apply for the clean technology ITC for \nacquisitions of off-road zero-emission vehicles and \nacquisitions and installations of low-carbon heat \nequipment. \nUnder proposed changes, effective November 28, 2023, it \nwas clarified that the exemptions would apply to the \npreparation or installation of clean technology property \ndescribed in Schedule II of the Regulations: \n■ in subparagraph (d)(i) of CCA class 43.1 – certain active \nsolar heating equipment and ground source heat pump \nsystem equipment \n■ in class 56 – zero-emission self-propelled equipment that \nis not a motor vehicle, including certain additions and \nalterations \nClean technology property includes: \n■ certain zero-emission power generation technologies \n(including concentrated solar energy equipment and \nsmall modular nuclear reactors) \n■ storage equipment for zero-emission energy and non-\nroad zero-emission vehicles \n■ geothermal energy systems, unless they are used for \ngeothermal energy projects that will co-produce oil, gas, \nor other fossil fuels \nUnder proposed changes, for businesses investing in \neligible property that is acquired and becomes available for \nuse on or after November 21, 2023, eligibility for the credit \nwould include systems that produce electricity, heat, or \nboth electricity and heat, from eligible waste biomass. \nBusinesses can fully benefit from both this credit and the \nAtlantic investment tax credit. However, generally they \ncannot claim the clean technology tax credit if they claim \none of the following credits for the same property: \n■ CCUS ITC \n■ clean hydrogen ITC \n■ clean technology manufacturing ITC \n■ clean electricity ITC \nBusinesses may claim more than one clean economy ITC for \nthe same project, if the project includes different types of \neligible property. \nTo claim the credit, complete Schedule 75, Clean Technology \nInvestment Tax Credit, and file it with your return for the tax \nyear you are entitled to claim the credit for.

Otherwise, \nthe credit rate would be reduced by 10 percentage points. \nUnder proposed changes, effective for property that is \nacquired and becomes available for use in an eligible \nproject on or after December 16, 2024, the clean hydrogen \nITC would be expanded to include projects that produce \nhydrogen from methane pyrolysis. \nEligible equipment would include property that is used to \nproduce all or substantially all hydrogen from methane \npyrolysis (determined without reference to any solid \ncarbon that is produced), such as: \n■ pyrolysis reactors \n■ heat exchangers \n■ separation equipment and purifiers \n■ compression and on-site storage equipment \nSupport for the capital costs of the pyrolysis reactor system \nwould be limited to $3,000 per tonne of annual hydrogen \nproduction capacity. \nAs is the case for the clean hydrogen ITC in general, eligible \nequipment would also include dual-use electricity and heat \nequipment, project support equipment, ammonia \nproduction equipment, and oxygen production equipment, \nprovided they satisfy the existing requirements. \nBusinesses can fully benefit from both this credit and the \nAtlantic investment tax credit. However, generally they \ncannot claim the clean hydrogen tax credit if they claim one \nof the following credits for the same property: \n■ CCUS ITC \n■ clean technology ITC \n■ clean technology manufacturing ITC \n■ clean electricity ITC \nBusinesses may claim more than one clean economy ITC for \nthe same project, if the project includes different types of \neligible property. \nTo claim the credit, when available, complete Schedule 74, \nClean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit, and file it with your \nreturn for the tax year you are entitled to claim the credit \nfor. You must file the required information by the later of \nDecember 31, 2025, and the day that is one year after your \nfiling due date for the tax year you are entitled to claim the \ncredit for.

One of these \nincludes changing to a \"primarily\" test for property used in \nqualifying mineral activities expected to produce qualifying \nmaterials at mine or well sites. \nEligible expenditures would include investments in eligible \nproperty used in qualifying mineral activities that are \nexpected to produce primarily (more than 50%—rather \nthan 90%) qualifying materials at mine or well sites, \nincluding tailing ponds and mills located at these sites. \nThe credit applies to property that is acquired and becomes \navailable for use after 2023. It will be gradually phased out \nstarting with property that becomes available for use in \n2032 as follows: \n■ 30% in 2024 to 2031 \n■ 20% in 2032 \n■ 10% in 2033 \n■ 5% in 2034 \nThe credit will no longer be in effect for property that \nbecomes available for use after 2034. \nNote \nThe labour requirements do not apply to the clean \ntechnology manufacturing ITC. \nBusinesses can fully benefit from both this credit and the \nAtlantic investment tax credit.

The maximum credit available is $13,750 for \neach eligible newsroom employee per year. The credit \namount is reduced by the amount received from the Aid to \nPublishers component of the Canada Periodical Fund. \nNote \nAs a temporary measure for four years, the cap on \nlabour expenditures per eligible newsroom employee is \nincreased from $55,000 to $85,000. As well, the tax credit \nrate is increased from 25% to 35%. These changes apply \nto qualifying labour expenditures incurred after 2022. \nThe rate will return to 25% for expenditures incurred \nafter 2026. Transitional rules apply to prorate these \nchanges if an organization’s tax year does not follow a \ncalendar year. \nTo be a QJO, as defined in subsection 125.6(1), the \norganization must be a qualified Canadian journalism \norganization (QCJO), as defined in subsection 248(1), and \nmust also meet both of the following additional criteria: \n■ it does not hold a licence, as defined in subsection 2(1) of \nthe Broadcasting Act \n■ if it is a corporation having share capital, it meets the \nconditions in subparagraph (e)(iii) of the definition of \nCanadian newspaper in subsection 19(5) \nTo be a QCJO, an organization must apply for and be \ndesignated as a QCJO by the minister of National Revenue. \nAn organization is deemed to have become designated as a \nQCJO on the date that it applies for designation with the \nCRA, unless otherwise specified by the minister. The CRA \ncan revoke a QCJO’s designation when it no longer meets \nthe eligibility requirements, but the CRA must consider any \nadvice provided by an advisory board before revoking an \norganization’s designation. \nA credit can be claimed by a member (other than a \npartnership member and a specified member) of a QJO that \nis a partnership, based on the relative specified proportions, \nas defined in subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act, of \neach qualifying member for the relevant fiscal period. The \ncredit allocated by the partnership to the partner is taxable \nto the partner and the partner must include it in their \nbusiness income in the same tax year. \nFor details on how to apply for designation as a QCJO, go \nto canada.ca/support-canadian-journalism and select \n“Qualified Canadian journalism organization”. \nA QCJO can go to canada.ca/support-canadian-journalism \nand select “Canadian journalism labour tax credit” for more \ninformation on eligibility for claiming the refundable tax \ncredit and for details on calculating the credit. \nTo claim the credit, file a completed Schedule 58, Canadian \nJournalism Labour Tax Credit, with your return for the year. \nOn line 798 of the return, enter the amount of the credit you \nare claiming. \nReferences \nSection 125.6 \nSubsection 248(1) \nLines 800 and 801 – Tax withheld at source \nThis is the amount shown as “income tax deducted” on any \ninformation slips, such as NR4, T4A, or T4A-NR, you may \nhave received.\n\n\n\n=== Page 141 ===\n\ncanada.ca/taxes \n141 \nOn line 800, enter the total amount of income tax deducted \nfrom all your information slips.

Then, it will refund or transfer \nthe excess overpayment according to the code you enter. \nThe CRA will do this only if all the required returns have \nbeen filed on the account and all related accounts. \nNote \nUnder subsection 220(6) of the Income Tax Act a \ncorporation may assign any amount payable under this \nAct. However, according to subsection 220(7) the \nminister of National Revenue “is not required to pay to \nthe assignee, the assigned amount.” As an alternative, \nthe CRA will review a request to send the refund to a \n“care of” address. However, a refund issued in this \nmanner will still be issued in the name of the corporation \n(see the third bullet above). \nThe payment of refunds and rebates will be withheld until \nall required returns, of which the minister of National \nRevenue has knowledge, have been filed. \nReference \nSubsection 164(2.01) \nLine 896 – If the corporation is a \nCanadian-controlled private corporation \nthroughout the tax year, does it qualify for the \none-month extension of the date the balance \nof tax is due? \nTick the yes or no box.

        "text": "canada.ca/taxes \nWhat’s new \n \nFederal, provincial, and territorial \nbudgets for 2024 \nNew items in this guide are outlined in colour. These \ninclude changes introduced in the 2024 federal, provincial, \nor territorial budgets. This guide may contain changes that \nhad not yet become law at the time of publishing. \nCanada carbon rebate for small \nbusinesses \nA new refundable tax credit is available to return a portion \nof fuel charge proceeds collected under the federal carbon \npollution pricing system to eligible Canadian-controlled \nprivate corporations (CCPCs). \nTo be eligible for a Canada carbon rebate for a calendar \nyear, a corporation must: \n■ have had no more than a total of 499 employees in all \nprovinces in Canada in the calendar year \n■ for the 2019 to 2023 calendar years, file a tax return for its \n2023 tax year by July 15, 2024, and \n■ have been a CCPC at all times in the tax year ending \nin 2023 \nThe tax credit amount will be: \n■ the total number of persons the CCPC employed in each \ndesignated province, for each calendar year from 2019 to \n2023, multiplied by \n■ the fuel return the minister of Finance specified for that \ndesignated province for that calendar year \nThe designated provinces are Newfoundland and \nLabrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New \nBrunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. \nCCPCs will not have to apply for this tax credit. Once the \ncorporation files a tax return for a tax year ending in 2023, \nthe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will determine the \ncorporation’s eligibility and, generally, issue the rebate to it. \nFor calendar years after 2023, the Canada carbon rebate will \nbe determined in a similar way – the CRA will \nautomatically calculate the rebate for eligible CCPCs that \nfiled a tax return on or before July 15 of the next calendar \nyear. \nFor the 2024-25 and later fuel charge years: \n■ small businesses that have between 1 and 20 employees \nacross Canada would qualify for a minimum payment \namount as if they had 20 employees \n■ corporations would have their payment amounts \nreduced on a straight-line basis when the number of \nemployees across Canada is between 300 and 500. The \npayment amount would be zero once the number of \nemployees across Canada reaches 500 \n■ the rebate would be newly available to cooperative \ncorporations and credit unions \n■ proceeds will continue to be returned automatically to \neligible corporations through direct deposits and cheques \nfrom the CRA, separately from CRA tax refunds \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency \n/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax \n-credits/canada-carbon-rebate-small-businesses. \nGlobal minimum tax \nA new global minimum tax was introduced to ensure that \nlarge multinational enterprises (MNEs) are subject to a \nminimum effective tax rate of at least 15% on their profits in \neach jurisdiction they operate in. Large MNEs are \nentreprises with more than €750 million in worldwide \nrevenues on a consolidated group basis. \nThe new tax applies to fiscal years starting on or after \nDecember 31, 2023. Corporations that are subject to this tax \nmust file applicable returns separately from their T2 \nCorporation Income Tax Return. \nExempt interest and financing \nexpenses on purpose-built residential \nrentals and regulated energy utility \nbusinesses \nThe definition of “exempt interest and financing expenses” \nin subsection 18.2(1) provides an exemption from the \nexcessive interest and financing limitation (EIFEL) rules for \ninterest and financing expenses (IFE) incurred in respect of \nthe financing of certain Canadian public-private \npartnership infrastructure projects. \nUnder proposed changes, this definition would be \namended by adding two elections: \n■ an election to exempt certain IFE incurred before \nJanuary 1, 2036, in respect of arm’s length financing \nused to: \n– build or acquire an eligible purpose-built residential \nrental \n– convert a property into an eligible purpose-built \nresidential rental in Canada \n■ an election to exempt IFE incurred in respect of an arm’s \nlength borrowing or financing used for the purpose of \ngaining or producing income from a regulated energy \nutility business in Canada \nA purpose-built residential rental would be a building or \npart of a building situated in Canada: \n■ containing either: \n– at least 10 residential rental units (that is, housing units \nused or intended for use as rented residential premises \nand not provided to the travelling or vacationing \npublic) \n– at least 4 residential rental units that are private (a unit \nwith a private kitchen, bathroom, and living area), and",

This change would apply to \nbankruptcy proceedings that started after April 15, 2024. \nReporting rules for digital platform \noperators \nNew reporting requirements have been introduced for \nthe 2024 calendar year for platform operators in select \nsegments of the digital economy under Part XX (which \ncame into force January 1, 2024). Starting in January 2025, \nreporting platform operators have to file an information \nreturn on sellers using their platform to generate revenue in \nselect segments of the platform economy. For more \ninformation, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs \n/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/reporting \n-rules-digital-platforms. \nSynthetic equity arrangement \nA corporation can generally deduct the amount of any \ndividends received on a share of a corporation resident in \nCanada. However, this is subject to certain limitations. One \nof these limitations is an anti-avoidance rule that denies the \ndividend received deduction in respect of synthetic equity \narrangements (SEA). The anti-avoidance rule does not \napply for SEA for which the taxpayer has established that \nno tax-indifferent investor has all or substantially all of the \nrisk of loss and opportunity for gain or profit in respect of \nthe share. \nUnder proposed changes, this anti-avoidance rule would be \nsimplified by removing the tax-indifferent investor \nexception (including the exchange traded exception). \nCorporations would therefore be unable to claim the \ndeduction for dividends received on a share there is a SEA \nfor, without any exceptions. This would apply to dividends \nreceived after December 31, 2024. \nWithholding for non-resident service \nproviders \nCurrently, a person who pays a fee, commission, or other \namount to a non-resident for services provided in Canada \nis required to withhold 15% of the payment and remit it to \nthe CRA. Effective on royal assent, the CRA would be able \nto waive this withholding requirement over a specific \nperiod under certain conditions. See page 11. \nAvoidance of tax debts \nA new supplementary rule was announced to strengthen \nthe existing tax debt anti‑avoidance rule that is intended to \nprevent taxpayers from avoiding their tax liabilities by \ntransferring their assets to non-arm’s length persons for \ninsufficient consideration. \nUnder the new supplementary rule, where certain \nconditions are met, the property transferred by the tax \ndebtor would be deemed to have been transferred to the \ntransferee for the purposes of the tax debt avoidance rule. \nThis would ensure that the tax debt avoidance rule applies \nin situations where property has been transferred from a \ntax debtor to a person and, as part of the same transaction \nor series, property has been received by a non-arm’s length \nperson. \nIn addition, the existing penalty would be extended to tax \ndebt avoidance planning that is subject to the \nsupplementary rule. The penalty is equal to the lesser of: \n■ 50% of the tax that is attempted to be avoided \n■ $100,000 plus any amount the person, or a related person, \nis entitled to receive or obtain regarding the planning \nactivity \nTo further enhance the effectiveness of the tax debt \nanti-avoidance rule, it is proposed that taxpayers who \nparticipate in tax debt avoidance planning would be jointly \nand severally, or solidarily, liable for the full amount of the \navoided tax debt. This amount would include any portion \nthe planner retained as a fee. These measures would apply \nto transactions or series of transactions that occur after \nApril 15, 2024. See page 16. \nReportable and notifiable transactions \npenalty \nThe general penalty provision for failure to file an \ninformation return is removed for reportable or notifiable \ntransactions, as there are specific penalty provisions under \nthe mandatory disclosure rules (MDR) that apply. This is \ndeemed to have come into force on June 22, 2023, which is \nthe coming into force date of the specific penalty provisions \nunder the MDR. See page 19. \nNon-compliance with information \nrequests \nUnder proposed changes, effective on royal assent, the \ninformation gathering provisions would be amended by: \n■ creating a new notice of non-compliance \n■ providing the possibility to require that any required \ninformation or document be provided under oath \n■ adding a penalty when the CRA issues a compliance \norder or a notice of non-compliance \n■ expanding the rules to stop the reassessment limitation \nclock \nSee page 21. \nExcessive interest and financing \nexpenses limitation (EIFEL) rules \nNew EIFEL rules limit the net amount of interest and \nfinancing expenses (interest and financing expenses minus",

See page 83. \nScientific research and experimental \ndevelopment \nThe Government announced that, for tax years that begin \non or after December 16, 2024: \n■ the annual expenditure limit on which CCPCs are \nentitled to earn an enhanced 35% investment tax credit \nwould increase from $3 million to $4.5 million; \n■ the prior-year taxable capital phase-out thresholds for the \nenhanced credit would increase from $10 million and \n$50 million, to $15 million and $75 million, respectively; \n■ the enhanced refundable SR&ED credit would be \nextended to Canadian public corporations \nFor property acquired after December 15, 2024 (or lease \ncosts first becoming payable after that date) the pre-2014 \neligibility of capital expenditures would be reinstated to \nboth the SR&ED income deduction and the SR&ED ITC. \nQualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC would \nbe entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate \nof 40% on their capital expenditures. See page 89. \nMutual fund corporation \nUnder proposed changes, for tax years starting after 2024, a \ncorporation will not qualify as a mutual fund corporation if \nit is controlled by or for the benefit of a corporate group \n(including a corporate group that consists of any \ncombination of corporations, individuals, trusts, and \npartnerships that do not deal with each other at arm’s \nlength). \nThis new rule would not apply to mutual fund corporations \nincorporated within the two previous years and where \nspecified persons hold shares with a value of $5 million or \nless.

The corporation is then required to \naccrue income under the adjusted stub period accrual \n(ASPA) regime for the portion of the partnership’s fiscal \nperiod that falls in the corporation’s tax year (the stub \nperiod). These rules do not affect a corporation’s capital \ndividend account which is to be determined without \nreference to section 34.2. \nSince the ASPA income inclusion in a tax year is an \nestimate of the stub period income, the corporation is \nentitled to claim that same amount in the immediately \nfollowing tax year. Both the ASPA income inclusion and \nthe treatment of that same amount in the following year are \nsubject to the characterization rules under \nsubsection 34.2(5). They are deemed to have the same \ncharacter and be in the same proportions as the partnership \nincome that they relate to. As such, the claim in the \nimmediately following tax year may be a deduction or a \ndeemed allowable capital loss, whichever applies. A \ncorporation may have ASPA in respect of more than one \npartnership and, in such cases, the ASPA rules apply to the \ncorporation on a partnership-by-partnership basis. \nIn general, a corporation (other than a professional \ncorporation) has to include in its income for a tax year its \nASPA for a partnership if all of the following apply: \n■ the corporation has a significant interest in the \npartnership at the end of the last fiscal period of the \npartnership that ends in the tax year \n■ another fiscal period of the partnership begins in the tax \nyear and ends after the tax year of the corporation \n■ at the end of the tax year, the corporation is entitled to a \nshare of an income, loss, taxable capital gain, or \nallowable capital loss of the partnership for the fiscal \nperiod referred to in the preceding bullet \nA corporation has a significant interest in a partnership if \nthe corporation, or the corporation together with affiliated \nor related parties, is entitled to more than 10% of the \npartnership’s income or loss (or assets, net of liabilities, if \nthe partnership were to cease to exist). \nThese rules apply to any corporation (described above), \nthat is a member of a partnership, even if the partnership \nhas a member that is an individual or a professional \ncorporation that is subject to the 1995 rules limiting deferral \nfor unincorporated businesses. \nThe definition of adjusted stub period accrual in \nsubsection 34.2(1) gives the formulas for calculating a \ncorporation’s ASPA in respect of a partnership. The ASPA \nformula allows the corporation to designate two reductions. \nThe first designation concerns qualified resource expenses \nincurred by the partnership during the corporation’s stub \nperiod. The second allows a corporate partner to make a \ndiscretionary designation to reduce its ASPA to reflect its \nknowledge of the actual partnership income for the stub \nperiod. Once filed, the designations cannot be amended or \nrevoked. If the amount of the discretionary designation is \ntoo high, creating an income shortfall, the corporation may \nbe subject to an additional income inclusion. The additional \nincome inclusion may increase if the shortfall is above \na 25% threshold. \nUnder certain conditions, a corporation (other than a \nprofessional corporation) that becomes a member of a \npartnership in a tax year may make a designation to \napportion its income from the partnership between two tax \nyears: \n■ the tax year in which the fiscal period of the partnership \nbegan \n■ the tax year in which the fiscal period of the partnership \nends \nTo calculate the income inclusion under section 34.2 and, if \napplicable, the income shortfall adjustment and additional \namount under section 34.3, use Schedule 71, Income \nInclusion for Corporations that Are Members of Single-Tier \nPartnerships, or Schedule 72, Income Inclusion for Corporations \nthat Are Members of Multi-Tier Partnerships. These are \nworksheets and you do not have to file them with your \nreturn.

This is the case unless it is \nreasonable to conclude that one of the main reasons for the \nacquisition of a tax shelter, or the issuance of a \nflow-through share, was to avoid the reportable \ntransactions provisions under subsection 237.3. \nFor more information on examples of activities that would \nnot meet a hallmark and therefore not have to meet a \nreporting obligation, go to canada.ca/mandatory \n-disclosure-rules#toc6. \nNotifiable transactions and reportable \nuncertain tax treatments \nNew requirements have been enacted: \n■ to report notifiable transactions. The minister of \nNational Revenue has the authority to designate, with \nthe agreement of the minister of Finance, a transaction or \na series of transactions as a notifiable transaction. \nReporting requirements (and exception to the rule) \nsimilar to those for reportable transactions apply with the \ninclusion of a prescribed form. A notifiable transaction is \na transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar \nto, a designated transaction, or a transaction in a series of \ntransactions that is the same as, or substantially similar \nto, a designated series of transactions. This applies to \nnotifiable transactions entered into after June 21, 2023. \nFor a list of notifiable transactions designated by the \nminister of National Revenue, go to canada.ca \n/notifiable-transactions.

A reportable uncertain tax \ntreatment is a tax treatment that a corporation uses or \nplans to use in its income tax filings (including, for \ngreater certainty, the decision not to include a particular \namount in a return of income) and for which there is \nuncertainty over whether the tax treatment will be \naccepted as being in accordance with tax law.

The scope of an assessment, \nreassessment, or additional assessment during the extended \nreassessment period for a taxpayer’s tax year is limited to \nthe extent that it can reasonably be regarded as relating to \nthe reportable transaction, notifiable transaction, or \nreportable uncertain tax treatment. \nIf a corporation has a reporting requirement for a \ntransaction relevant to the corporation’s income tax return \nfor a tax year, the normal reassessment period will not start \nfor the transaction until the corporation has complied with \nthe reporting requirement. As a result, if a corporation does \nnot comply with a mandatory disclosure reporting \nrequirement for a tax year for a transaction, a reassessment \nof the year will not become statute-barred for the \ntransaction only. \nPenalties \nSince there are specific penalty provisions under the \nmandatory disclosure rules (MDR) that apply to reportable \nor notifiable transactions, the general penalty provision for \nfailure to file an information return is removed for these \ntransactions. This is deemed to have come into force on \nJune 22, 2023, which is the coming into force date of the \nspecific penalty provisions under the MDR. \nFailure to report could result in suspension of the tax \nbenefit, a penalty for failure to report, or both. \nFor transactions entered into after June 21, 2023, penalties \nwill apply for each failure to report a reportable transaction \nor a notifiable transaction: \n■ to persons who enter into such transactions, or for whom \na tax benefit results from such transactions. The penalty \nis equal to: \n– $500 per week for each failure to report the transaction, \nup to the greater of $25,000 and 25% of the tax benefit \n– for a corporation with assets having a total carrying \nvalue of $50 million or more for its last tax year that \nends before the day on which the information return is \nrequired to be filed, $2,000 per week for each failure to \nreport the transaction, up to the greater of $100,000 and \n25% of the tax benefit \n■ to advisors and promoters of such transactions and \npersons who do not deal at arm’s length with them and \nwho are entitled to a fee for the transactions.

Under proposed changes, effective on royal assent, \nthese rules would be amended so that they apply: \n■ when a corporation seeks a judicial review of any \nrequirement or notice to provide information issued to \nthe corporation or to a person that does not deal at arm’s \nlength with the corporation in relation to the audit and \nenforcement process \n■ during any period a notice of non-compliance is \noutstanding \nNote \nThe CRA can send requirements for information, \nincluding those for foreign-based information, to banks \nand credit unions electronically, rather than delivering \nthem in person or by registered or certified mail. Written \nconsent of the bank or credit union is required before \nrequirements can be sent electronically. \nUnlimited reassessment period \nThe CRA can reassess a return at any time, including when: \n■ the corporation has made a misrepresentation because of \nneglect, carelessness, wilful default, or fraud in either \nfiling the return or supplying information required by \nthe Act \n■ the corporation filed Form T2029, Waiver in Respect of the \nNormal Reassessment Period or Extended Reassessment \nPeriod, with a tax services office before the normal \nreassessment period expires. Form T2029 can be filed up \nto three more years after the end of the normal \nreassessment period if the waiver applies to one of the \nsituations previously described under “Extended \nreassessment period” \nNote \nIf you want to revoke a waiver that was previously filed \nto extend the normal reassessment period for a certain \ntax year, file Form T652, Notice of Revocation of Waiver, at \nyour tax services office. The revocation will take effect \nsix months after you file Form T652. \nSale or disposition of real estate \n The CRA may at any time make an assessment, \nreassessment, or additional assessment of an income tax \nreturn beyond the normal reassessment period for any of \nthe following reasons: \n■ the corporation does not report in its initial income tax \nreturn a sale or other disposition of a real or immovable \nproperty that is capital property of the corporation \n■ the partnership of which the corporation is a member did \nnot report the sale or other disposition in the initial \npartnership information return \nIf the corporation later amends its return to report the \ndisposition of the property (for example by filing a request \nfor adjustments under subsection 245(6)), the CRA may still \nmake a reassessment outside of the normal reassessment \nperiod within three years of the amendment being filed. \nUnder this extended reassessment period, the reassessment \nis limited to amounts reasonably relating to the unreported \nor previously unreported disposition of real or immovable \nproperty that is capital property of the corporation or \npartnership, as the case may be. \nReferences \nSubsections 152(3.1), 152(4), 152(4.01), and 152(4.1) \nIC75-7, Reassessment of a Return of Income \nHow to request a reassessment \nYou can request a reassessment electronically using the \nlatest commercial tax preparation software packages, or \nsend a letter to the tax centre that serves the corporation.

That’s why \nthe CRA says: “Talk to us.” \nIf you have new or additional information, you or your \nauthorized representative can ask for a change online at \nMy Business Account, Represent a Client, or by writing to \nthe CRA. Many disputes are resolved this way. \nIf you disagree with an assessment or a determination, you \ncan make a formal objection. \nFiling an objection is the first step in the formal process of \nresolving your dispute. You have 90 days after the date of \nthe notice of assessment or determination to file an \nobjection. \nYou can file an objection: \n■ online in My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra \n-business-account, or in Represent a Client at \ncanada.ca/taxes-representatives, by selecting “File a \nformal dispute (Notice of Objection)” under \n“Corporation Income Tax” \n■ by mail, using Form T400A, Notice of Objection – Income \nTax Act, or writing to the chief of appeals at your \nAppeals Intake Centre (see appendix B of Guide P148) \nIn all cases, you have to explain why you disagree and \ninclude all relevant facts and supporting documents. \nFor large corporations, your objection must: \n■ reasonably describe each issue \n■ specify for each issue the relief you are seeking, \nexpressed as the amount of a change in the income, \ntaxable income, loss, taxes payable, refundable amounts, \nand overpayments or balance of unclaimed outlays, \nexpenses, or other amounts of the corporation \n■ provide facts and reasons the corporation relied on for \neach issue \nReference \nSection 165 \nA large corporation that objects to an assessment will have \nto pay 50% of the disputed amount. A corporation is a large \ncorporation if the total taxable capital employed in Canada \nat the end of the tax year by the corporation and its related \ncorporations is over $10 million. The corporation also has to \npay the full amount of taxes not in dispute. \nReference \nSubsection 225.1(7) \nFor more information about objections and appeals, see \nGuide P148, Resolving your dispute: Objection rights under the \nIncome Tax Act, or go to canada.ca/cra-file-objection. \nDisputing loss determinations \nThe formal process of resolving a dispute does not usually \napply to loss amounts under dispute, because there is no \ntax, interest, or penalty involved. \nHowever, a corporation may request a loss determination if \nit does not agree with the amount of the losses assessed by \nthe CRA. The CRA will determine the amount of the loss \nand confirm in writing by issuing Form T67AM, Notice of \nDetermination/Redetermination of a Loss. \nOnce the corporation has received the notice of \ndetermination, it can file an objection within 90 days after \nthe date of the notice. \nNote \nYou cannot request a loss determination if the CRA \nassessed your loss to be the same as what you reported. \nIf the corporation asks, the CRA will make determinations \nof the following amounts: \n■ a non-capital loss \n■ a net capital loss \n■ a restricted farm loss \n■ a farm loss \n■ a limited partnership loss \nSend any requests for loss determinations to your tax \nservices office or tax centre. \nReferences \nSubsections 152(1.1) and 152(1.2)",

In \nthis case, attach a letter to your return that says you are \nmaking an election under paragraph 249(4)(b). \nWhere shares of a corporation are transferred to an estate \nbecause of a death, there is no acquisition of control. In \ngeneral, this also applies when the transfer is made to a \nrelated person. As a result, there is no deemed tax year-end \nand no tax return is required to be filed. For more \ninformation, see subsection 256(7). \nNotes \nThe acquisition of control under subsection 256(9) of a \ncorporation is usually deemed to occur at the beginning \nof the day on which the acquisition takes place. \nHowever, the particular time of day that the acquisition \nof control took place will be recognized if the \ncorporation makes an election under subsection 256(9). \nTo elect under subsection 256(9), include a note with \nyour return for the tax year ending immediately before \ncontrol was acquired and enter the hours and minutes \nthat specify the time of day at line 065. \nThe deeming rule does not apply when determining the \nstatus of a corporation as a small business corporation or \na Canadian-controlled private corporation at the time of \nthe transaction that caused the change of control.

You do not need the minister’s approval for the \nchanged tax year. \nFile a return for the tax year that ends immediately before \nthe change.

Control can be exerted \neither directly or indirectly in any way. A person or a \ngroup of persons can control a corporation. Keep in mind \nthat, in this context, a person can be either an individual or \na corporation. \nControl includes both de jure control and de facto control. \nDe jure control is the right of control that depends on a \nperson owning enough shares of a corporation to give that \nperson a majority of the voting power. De facto control, or \nfactual control, occurs when a corporation is subject to any \ndirect or indirect influencing that, if exercised, would result \nin actual control being exerted. \nWhen determining whether a taxpayer has any direct or \nindirect influence that, if exercised, would result in factual \ncontrol of the corporation, one must: \n■ take into consideration all factors that are relevant in the \ncircumstances \n■ not be limited to whether the taxpayer has a legally \nenforceable right or ability to make a change in the board \nof directors of the corporation, or the board’s power, or \nto exercise influence over the shareholder(s) who have \nthat right or ability. The previous factors are not \nmandatory in determining factual control \nIn general, a corporation is associated with another \ncorporation if it meets one of the following six conditions at \nany time in the tax year. Remember that controlled means \ndirectly or indirectly in any way. \nCondition 1 \nThe corporations are associated if one corporation controls \nthe other. \nExample \nCorp X owns 100% of the voting shares of Corp Y, which in \nturn owns 51% of the voting shares of Corp Z. \nCorp X is associated with Corp Y because it exerts direct \ncontrol over it. \nCorp X is associated with Corp Z because it exerts indirect \ncontrol over it. \n \nCondition 2 \nThe corporations are associated if both corporations are \ncontrolled by the same person or group of persons. \nCorporations may be associated because the same group of \npersons controls both corporations, but the members of this \ngroup do not act together and have no other connection to \neach other. \nCCPCs that are associated only because of this definition of \na group will NOT be considered associated when: \n■ calculating the refundable investment tax credit on \nqualified SR&ED expenditures \n■ calculating the expenditure limit \n■ allocating the expenditure limit \nFor this exception to apply, one of the corporations must \nhave at least one shareholder who is not common to both \ncorporations. \nThe corporations will continue to be associated for all other \npurposes of the Income Tax Act. \nExample \nBob owns 40% of the voting shares of Corp ABC and 30% of \nthe voting shares of Corp XYZ. Ike owns 20% of the voting \nshares of Corp ABC and 40% of the voting shares of \nCorp XYZ. \nAs a group, Bob and Ike control both companies. \nCorps ABC and XYZ are associated. \n \nCondition 3 \nThe corporations are associated if all of the following apply: \n■ each corporation is controlled by one person \n■ that person is related to the person controlling the other \ncorporation \n■ one of those persons owns at least 25% of the issued \nshares of any class, other than shares of a specified class, \nof the capital stock of each corporation",

Tax planning \nstrategies have developed that rely on a loss of CCPC status \nbefore the realization of investment income. \nThe concept of substantive CCPC eliminates this potential \nadvantage by taxing passive income earned by a \nsubstantive CCPC in the same way as if the corporation \nwas a CCPC. \nA substantive CCPC is a private corporation (other than a \nCCPC) that at any time in a tax year: \n■ is controlled, directly or indirectly in any way, by one or \nmore Canadian resident individuals, or \n■ would, if each share of the capital stock of a corporation \nthat is owned by a Canadian resident individual were \nowned by a particular individual, be controlled by the \nparticular individual \nFurther, a corporation is considered a substantive CCPC \nwhen the corporation would be a CCPC but for the fact that \na non-resident or public corporation has a right to acquire \nits shares. \nMeasures regarding the deferral of tax using foreign \nentities generally apply to tax years ending after \nApril 6, 2022, except that the measures apply to tax years \nstarting after April 6, 2022, if both the following apply: \n■ the corporation’s first tax year ending after April 6, 2022, \nis because of an acquisition of control caused by the sale \nof all or substantially all of the shares of a corporation to \nan arm’s length purchaser before 2023 \n■ the corresponding written purchase and sale agreement \nwas entered into before April 7, 2022 \nCCPC and substantive CCPC – Deferral of tax using \nforeign resident corporations \nChanges to the foreign accrual property income (FAPI) \nrules eliminate the tax deferral advantage that was \navailable to CCPCs and their shareholders earning \ninvestment income through a controlled foreign affiliate. \nThese measures, which affect both CCPCs and substantive \nCCPCs, apply to tax years starting after April 6, 2022. \nAside from the two measures above, substantive CCPCs \nwill continue to be treated as non-CCPCs for all other \npurposes of the Income Tax Act. \nLine 291 – Did the corporation immigrate to \nCanada during the tax year? \nTick the yes or no box.",

On line 295 of Schedule 1, \nenter the non-deductible amount for non-compliant short-\nterm rentals. \nGenerally, the net income (loss) reported on your financial \nstatements will not be the same as the net income (loss) \nrequired for tax purposes. This is because certain income \nand expenses reported on your financial statements or the \nGeneral Index of Financial Information (GIFI) may not be \nused in the calculation of net income (loss) for tax purposes. \nFor example, you do not deduct charitable donations when \ndetermining net income for tax purposes, as you would to \narrive at net income on your financial statement. \nNote \nCharitable donations are deducted (afterward) from net \nincome for tax purposes to arrive at taxable income. \nUse Schedule 1 to reconcile the net income (loss) reported \non your financial statements and the net income (loss) \nrequired for tax purposes. \nEnter net income or loss after income tax and extraordinary \nitems at amount A, page 1 of Schedule 1. Add the taxable \nitems and the non-allowable expenses listed on lines 101 \nto 199 and subtract from this the non-taxable items and \neligible expenses listed on lines 401 to 499. \nAdditions and deductions identified on lines 101 to 132 \nand 401 to 418 of Schedule 1 are the most common \nadditions and subtractions. For other additions and \ndeductions, see pages 3 and 4. \nSome expenses deducted on your income statement are not \nallowable for income tax purposes and are not identified on \nSchedule 1. In this case, use columns 605 and 295, and \nline 296, “Other additions”, on page 3. \nAlso, certain items included in income that are not taxable \nare not identified on this schedule. In such cases, complete \ncolumns 705 and 395, and line 396, “Other deductions”, on \npage 4. \nNotes \nOnly complete lines 203 and 302 if you are converting \nfrom an accrual basis to a cash basis. Otherwise, these \nlines should be left blank. \nThe deductible portion of expenses you incurred for \nfood, beverages, and entertainment is only 50% of \nwhichever is less: the expenditure actually incurred or \nthe amount that would be reasonable in the \ncircumstances. \nEighty percent of expenses for food and beverages \nconsumed by a long-haul truck driver during an eligible \ntravel period are deductible. For more information, see \nGuide T4002, Self-Employed Business, Professional, \nCommission, Farming, and Fishing Income, or go \nto canada.ca/taxes-employment-expenses and select \n“Transportation employees.” \nA full deduction is allowed for meals provided to an \nemployee at a temporary construction work camp, if \ncertain conditions are met.

If you make the designation, capital properties \nwill be considered as having been disposed of immediately \nbefore that person or group of persons acquired control of \nthe corporation. \nCompleting Schedule 6 \nTo help you complete Schedule 6, the following \nexplanations briefly set out the type of information to enter \nin each column and each part of the schedule. \nDate of acquisition \nIn this column, give the date you acquired the property. \nProceeds of disposition \nIn this column, indicate the proceeds of disposition. The \nproceeds of disposition are usually the selling price of the \nproperty. However, they can also include compensation \nthe corporation received for property that was destroyed, \nexpropriated, stolen, or damaged. \nFor a gift or a deemed disposition, the proceeds of \ndisposition are usually the fair market value of the property \nwhen its owner or use changes. \nReferences \nSection 54 \nS3-F3-C1, Replacement Property \nAdjusted cost base \nIn this column, indicate the cost of the property you used to \ncalculate any capital gain or loss. This amount is called the \nadjusted cost base (ACB). The ACB is the original cost of \nthe property that has been adjusted to reflect certain \ntransactions or occurrences that took place after acquiring \nthe property. \nThe cost of a capital property may be the actual cost, a \ndeemed cost, or the valuation-day value of the property. \nThe nature of the property and the circumstances under \nwhich you acquired it determine which cost of the capital \nproperty you should use. \nReferences \nSubsections 53(1) and 53(2) \nThe cost of property acquired after 1971 is usually the \nactual cost of acquiring it, including the purchase price plus \nany related costs, such as commissions, legal fees, and other \nreasonable expenses. It also includes the cost of additions \nand improvements to the property. It does not include \ncurrent expenses, such as maintenance and repair costs. \nSpecial rules apply when determining the cost of capital \nproperty owned on December 31, 1971. According to these \nrules, tax is not assessed and losses are not allowed for any \ngain or loss that arose before that date. \nWhen deductions from the cost base of a property (other \nthan a partnership interest) reduce the balance to a negative \namount at any time in the tax year, you are considered to \nhave realized a capital gain equal to the amount of the \nnegative balance, and the ACB becomes nil. \nYou cannot use later additions to the ACB to reduce \nprevious gains on the property that resulted from a \nnegative balance. You can only consider these additions \nwhen you determine future gains or losses. \nReference \nSubsection 40(3) \nParagraphs 53(1)(e) and 53(2)(c) outline the rules for \ndetermining the ACB of a partnership interest. \nYou have to reduce the ACB of a partnership interest by the \namount of any share purchase tax credit, and one-half of \nany scientific research and experimental development tax \ncredit the partnership allocated to the corporation. \nNote \nInterests in a partnership that a limited partner or an \ninactive partner holds are subject to the negative \nACB rule. \nOutlays and expenses \nIn this column, enter the amount of outlays and expenses \nyou deducted when calculating a gain or loss. You can \ndeduct most cash outlays the corporation used to put a \nproperty into saleable condition when you calculate a gain \nor loss. You can also deduct expenses incurred when \ndisposing of the property. These expenses include certain \nfixing-up costs, finder’s fees, commissions, surveyor’s fees, \ntransfer taxes, and other reasonable expenses incurred to \ndispose of the property. \nGain (or loss) \nIn the last column, enter the amount of the gain or loss as \ninstructed. \nA capital gain results when the proceeds of disposition of a \ncapital property are more than the ACB and any related \noutlays or expenses.

For \nmore information, go to canada.ca/cra-crypto-assets or see \nGuide T4037, Capital Gains. \nCategories of capital property \nThere are six categories of capital property you may have \ndisposed of during the tax year. The categories are: \n■ shares \n■ real estate \n■ bonds \n■ other properties \n■ personal-use property \n■ listed personal property \nThe first six parts of Schedule 6 reflect these six categories \nof capital property. \nPart 1 – Shares \nIn this part, list the shares disposed of during the tax year. \nGive the number of shares, the name of the corporation in \nwhich the shares were held, and the class of the shares. \nUsually, disposing of a share of the capital stock of a \ncorporation will result in a taxable capital gain or an \nallowable capital loss. However, if the corporation that is \ndisposing of the share is in the business of trading shares, \nthe resulting gain or loss is considered business income or \nloss. \nIf a share is converted because of a merger or an \namalgamation, subsection 248(1) deems a disposition to \nhave occurred. \nUnder paragraph 112(3)(b), a corporation (the shareholder) \nmust reduce the losses from the disposition of shares held \nas capital property by certain dividends received for those \nshares. This is called a stop-loss rule. Generally, this rule \ndoes not apply when the shareholder owns less than 5% of \nthe shares and has held these shares for over a year. \nOn line 160, enter the total adjustment for such losses \nidentified in Part 1. Enter the total amount of gain or loss \nrealized on disposition of shares at amount A. \nReference \nIT-328, Losses on Shares on Which Dividends Have Been Received \nPart 2 – Real estate \nIn this part, list all real estate disposed of during the tax \nyear. Give the municipal address of each property. \nDispositions of non-depreciable real property (unless the \nproperty is inventory) may result in a capital gain or loss. \nHowever, dispositions of depreciable property may result \nin a capital gain, a recapture of CCA, or a terminal loss. \nSee ”Column 10 – UCC” (undepreciated capital cost) on \npage 51 for details about terminal losses and recaptures. \nEnter the total amount of gain or loss realized on \ndisposition of real estate at amount B. \nReference \nIT-218, Profit, Capital Gains and Losses From the Sale of Real Estate, Including \nFarmland and Inherited Land and Conversion of Real Estate From Capital \nProperty to Inventory and Vice Versa \nPart 3 – Bonds \nIn this part, list all bonds disposed of during the tax year. \nGive the face value, the maturity date, and the issuer’s \nname for each type of bond. \nWhen you make a capital disposition of a debt obligation, \nthe amount of any realized discount or bonus received is \nusually considered a capital gain. Similarly, a premium \npaid is considered a capital loss, either when the obligation \nmatures or on the date you dispose of the obligation. \nEnter the total amount of gain or loss realized on \ndisposition of bonds at amount C. \nReference \nIT-479, Transactions in Securities \nPart 4 – Other properties \nIn this part, describe any capital property disposed of \nduring the tax year that you have not already reported in \nParts 1, 2, and 3. \nOther property includes capital debts established as bad \ndebts, debts in respect of the disposition of personal-use \nproperty established as bad debts, amounts that arise from \nforeign currency transactions, as well as capital gains or \nlosses allocated from partnerships and trusts. \nWhen an amount receivable on a capital account becomes \na bad debt and you elect on your return to have the \nprovisions of subsection 50(1) applied, a deemed \ndisposition occurs at the end of the year. You are \nconsidered to have reacquired the debt immediately \nafterwards at a cost of nil. This usually allows the \ncorporation to claim a bad debt as a capital loss in the year. \nAny later recovery of that debt will result in a capital gain. \nReferences \nSubsection 50(1) \nIT-159, Capital Debts Established to be Bad Debts \nYou can deduct, per subsection 50(2), capital losses in \nrespect of bad debts relating to the disposition of \npersonal-use property to a person with whom you deal at \narm’s length. \nThe amount of the loss cannot be more than the amount of \nthe gain reported on the disposition of the personal-use \nproperty. \nReference \nSubsection 50(2) \nForeign exchange gains or losses from buying or selling \ncapital properties are capital gains or capital losses.",

According to this rule, if \nthe adjusted cost base is less than $1,000, it is considered to \nbe $1,000. As well, when the proceeds of disposition are less \nthan $1,000, they are considered to be $1,000. \nThe $1,000 rule will not apply when donors acquire \npersonal-use property as part of an arrangement in which \nthe property is gifted to a qualified donee, such as a \nregistered charity. \nYou cannot deduct losses on dispositions of personal-use \nproperty (other than listed personal property or a debt that \nis personal-use property) from your income. \nEnter the total amount of gain realized on disposition of \npersonal-use property at amount E. \nReference \nSubsection 46(1) \nPart 6 – Listed personal property \nIn this part, describe any listed personal property disposed \nof during the tax year. \nListed personal property is a special category of \npersonal-use property that usually increases in value. The \nfollowing is a complete list of the different types of listed \npersonal property: \n■ prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other \nsimilar works of art \n■ jewellery \n■ rare folios, rare manuscripts, or rare books \n■ stamps \n■ coins \nIf you incur losses from disposing of listed personal \nproperty, you can only deduct these losses from capital \ngains realized from disposing of listed personal property. \nOn line 655, enter the amount of listed personal property \nlosses from previous years you want to apply against \ncurrent-year net listed personal property gains. Also, enter \nthis amount on line 530 of Schedule 4, Corporation Loss \nContinuity and Application. \nYou can apply any unabsorbed losses in the current year to \nreduce similar net gains realized in the three preceding \nyears, and in the following seven years.

In these cases, you can defer part of the capital \ngain to the year the corporation is due to receive the \nproceeds by setting up a capital gains reserve. By using \nreserves, you can spread a capital gain over a maximum of \nfive years. \nGenerally, a corporation that has made a gift of a \nnon-qualifying security to a qualified donee may claim a \nreserve for any gain realized on this security. The reserve \nclaimed by the corporation cannot exceed the eligible \namount of the gift. The eligible amount of a gift is the \namount by which the fair market value of the property that \nis the subject of the gift exceeds the amount of the \nadvantage, if any, in respect of the gift. \nA reserve can only be claimed if the donation is not \ndeducted for tax purposes and the donee does not dispose \nof the security or the security does not cease to be a \nnon-qualifying security. This reserve can only be claimed in \ntax years ending within 60 months of making the gift. \nThe reserve must be included in income if the corporation \nbecomes a non-resident or tax exempt. \nThe reserve that you can claim in a tax year cannot be more \nthan the lesser of the following two amounts: \nA.          Capital gain           × Amount not due until after \n \nProceeds of disposition  \n \nthe end of the year \nand \nB. \n■ for the year of disposition \n4/5 of the capital gain \n \n■ for the second year \n3/5 of the capital gain \n \n■ for the third year \n2/5 of the capital gain \n \n■ for the fourth year \n1/5 of the capital gain",

The CCA still \napplies on a declining-balance basis. \nA corporation may elect to not include in class 54 or 55 a \nvehicle that would otherwise be a zero-emission vehicle. \nWhen such an election is filed, the vehicle will no longer be \nconsidered to be a zero-emission vehicle. As a result, the \nvehicle will be included in its usual CCA class 10, 10.1 \nor 16. A corporation has to file this election with the \nminister of National Revenue in its return of income for the \ntax year in which the vehicle is acquired. \nAn eligible zero-emission vehicle is essentially a motor \nvehicle for use on streets and highways (excluding a trolley \nbus or vehicle operated only on rails). It must be fully \nelectric, or a plug-in hybrid that has a battery capacity of at \nleast 7 kWh, or fully powered by hydrogen. It must not \nhave been used, or acquired for use, for any purpose before \nit was acquired by the corporation, unless the corporation \nacquires it after March 1, 2020. \nIt cannot be a vehicle: \n■ for which the Government of Canada paid assistance \nunder a prescribed program such as the federal purchase \nincentive announced in the 2019 federal budget \n(presently there is only one prescribed program) \n■ that the corporation elected not to include in class 54 \nor 55 \n■ for which an amount has been deducted as CCA or a \nterminal loss has been claimed by another person or \npartnership \nIn addition, a zero-emission vehicle has to be acquired, and \nbecome available for use, after March 18, 2019, and \nbefore 2028. An enhanced first-year CCA is available as \nfollows: \n■ 100% after March 18, 2019, and before 2024 \n■ 75% after 2023 and before 2026 \n■ 55% after 2025 and before 2028 \nUnder proposed changes, the immediate expensing \nmeasure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for \nqualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, \nand that becomes available for use before 2030, with a \nfour-year phase out after 2029. \nFor the enhanced first-year allowance, the following step \nshould be done before calculating the CCA: \n■ increase the net capital cost addition to the new class for \nproperty that becomes available for use before 2028 as \nfollows: \n– For class 54, increase the capital cost addition by an \namount equal to: \n■ 2 1/3 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use before 2024 \n■ 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025 \n■ 5/6 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use after 2025 and \nbefore 2028 \n– For class 55, increase the capital cost addition by an \namount equal to: \n■ 1 ½ times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use before 2024 \n■ 7/8 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use in 2024 or 2025 \n■ 3/8 times the net addition to the class for property \nthat becomes available for use after 2025 and \nbefore 2028 \n■ suspend the existing CCA half-year rule \nMultiply the result by the prescribed CCA rate of 30% for \nclass 54 and 40% for class 55. \nThe CCA will apply to any remaining balance for the new \nclasses using the set rate for each class. \nThese measures do not change the total amount that can be \ndeducted over the life of the vehicle, it just allows a larger \ndeduction in the first year. \nA zero-emission passenger vehicle is an automobile that is \nincluded in class 54. When the capital cost of a \nzero-emission passenger vehicle is more than a prescribed \namount ($61,000 plus sales tax for vehicles acquired on or \nafter January 1, 2023), the capital cost of the vehicle is \ndeemed to be the prescribed amount. This amount will be \nreviewed annually. \nIf a zero-emission passenger vehicle is disposed of to a \nperson or partnership with which the corporation deals at \narm’s length and its cost is more than the prescribed \namount, the proceeds of disposition will be adjusted based \non a factor equal to the prescribed amount as a proportion \nof the actual cost of the vehicle. But for dispositions made \nafter July 29, 2019, the actual cost of the vehicle will be \nadjusted for payment or repayment of government \nassistance. \nZero-emission vehicles – Class 56 \nA temporary enhanced first-year capital cost \nallowance (CCA) of 100% is available for eligible \nzero-emission automotive equipment and vehicles (other \nthan motor vehicles) that currently do not benefit from the \naccelerated rate provided by classes 54 and 55. These \nvehicles and equipment are included in class 56. They have \nto be acquired after March 1, 2020, and become available for \nuse before 2028. \nThe enhanced CCA applies only for the tax year in which \nthe equipment or vehicle first becomes available for use.

In general, the \nincentive is made up of two elements: \n– an increase up to 50% of the net capital cost addition to \na class for property that becomes available for use \nbefore 2024 \n– suspending the existing CCA half-year rule (and \nequivalent rules for Canadian vessels and class 13 \nproperty) for property that becomes available for use \nbefore 2028. \n \nNote \nUnder the half-year rule, in general, property other \nthan AIIP or property included in classes 54 to 56, \nacquired during the tax year, is eligible for only 50% of \nthe normal maximum CCA for the year. You can claim \nfull CCA for that property in the next tax year. See \nRegulation 1100(2). \n■ Full expensing for manufacturers and processors – \nAllowing businesses to immediately write off the full \ncost of machinery and equipment used for the \nmanufacturing or processing of goods (class 53 or \nproperty included in class 43 and acquired after 2025, if \nthe property would have been included in class 53 if it \nhad been acquired in 2025). \n■ Full expensing for clean energy investments – Allowing \nbusinesses to immediately write off the full cost of \nspecified clean energy equipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). \nA phase-out will begin for property that becomes available \nfor use after 2023. For the 2024 and 2025 years, corporations \nmay immediately write off 75% of specified clean energy \nequipment (classes 43.1 and 43.2). \nUnder proposed changes, the immediate expensing \nmeasure for certain CCA classes would be reinstated for \nqualifying property acquired on or after January 1, 2025, \nand that becomes available for use before 2030, with a \nfour-year phase out after 2029. \nAn enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible \nCanadian development expenses and Canadian oil and gas \nproperty expenses incurred after November 20, 2018, and \nbefore 2028. The enhanced deduction will begin to be \nphased out for expenses made after 2023. \nThe accelerated investment incentive applies to property \nfor which CCA is calculated on a declining-balance basis \n(including class 14.1, intangible property), as well as \nproperty with straight-line depreciation (for example, \nleasehold improvement, patents, and limited period \nlicences). A phase-out will begin for property that becomes \navailable for use after 2023. \nIn certain situations, rules related to limited partners, \nspecified leasing properties, specified energy properties \nand rental properties can restrict a CCA deduction, or a loss \nfor such a deduction, that would otherwise be available. \nThese rules continue to apply. \nThe accelerated investment incentive does not change the \ntotal amount that can be deducted over the life of the \nproperty, it just allows a larger deduction in the first year. \nFor more information, go to canada.ca/taxes-accelerated \n-investment-income. \nReference \nRegulation 1104(4) \nS3-F8-C2, Tax Incentives for Clean Energy Equipment \nDesignated immediate expensing property \nDesignated immediate expensing property (DIEP) is a \nproperty (other than property included in classes 1 to 6, \n14.1, 17, 47, 49 and 51) that is acquired by a CCPC after \nApril 18, 2021, becomes available for use in the tax year and \nbefore 2024, is designated as such in prescribed form filed \nby the CCPC within 12 months of the filing-due date for the \ntax year the designation relates to.",

However, if you \ndisposed of the property for more than its capital cost, enter \nthe capital cost, not the actual proceeds of disposition. \nA capital gain results when you dispose of a depreciable \nproperty for more than its capital cost. However, losses on \ndepreciable property do not result in capital losses. They \nmay result in terminal losses. For details about terminal \nlosses, see column 22. \nColumn 9 – Proceeds of disposition of the DIEP \nFor any applicable DIEP reported in column 4, enter the \ntotal proceeds of disposition if you disposed of it during the \nyear. They are included in column 8 and shown separately \nin column 9. \nColumn 10 – UCC \nTo calculate the amount you have to enter in column 10, do \nthe following: \n■ add the amounts in columns 2 and 3 \n■ either subtract or add the amount in column 5 (subtract if \nit is a negative amount, or add if it is a positive amount) \n■ subtract the amount in column 8 \nYou cannot claim CCA in the following situations: \n■ the amount in column 10 is positive, and no property is \nleft in that class at the end of the tax year (a terminal \nloss) \n■ the amount in column 10 is negative (a recapture of \nCCA) \nTerminal loss \nA terminal loss results when you dispose of all the \nproperty in a particular class and there is an amount of \nundepreciated capital cost left in column 10. You have to \ndeduct the terminal loss from income. If applicable, enter \nthe positive amount from column 10 in column 22. For \ndetails, see example 1 under the heading “Schedule 8 \nexamples” that follows. \nRecapture of CCA \nIf the amount in column 10 is negative, you have a \nrecapture of CCA. A recapture of CCA occurs when the \nproceeds of disposition in column 8 are more than the total \nof columns 2 and 3, plus or minus the amount in column 5 \nof that class. \nYou have to add the recapture to income. If applicable, \nenter the negative amount from column 10 in column 21 as \na positive.

If a specific rate has not \nbeen provided for a particular class of property, enter N/A \nin this column. \nEnter a rate only if you are using the declining balance \nmethod. In this method, the CCA is calculated by \nmultiplying a constant rate by the diminishing balance \nevery year. \nNote \nSome asset classes use the straight-line method to \ncalculate the CCA. In this method, the CCA is calculated \nby dividing the original amount by the number of years \nthat corresponds to the life expectancy of the property. \nTherefore, the deducted amount stays the same from one \nyear to the other (except the first and last year, if the \nhalf-year rule applies for property acquired before \nNovember 21, 2018) and you do not have to enter a rate. \nExample \nDeclining balance method – The capital cost of an asset \nother than an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, \nor a property to which the immediate expensing was \napplied, is $780,000. The rate for the class is 10% with a \nhalf-year rule. \nFirst year:  \n10% × $780,000 = $78,000  \n$78,000 ÷ 2 = $39,000 CCA (half-year rule) \nSecond year:  \n$780,000 – $39,000 = $741,000 (undepreciated capital cost) \n$741,000 × 10% = $74,100 CCA \nThird year: \n$741,000 – $74,100 = $666,900 (undepreciated capital cost) \n$666,900 × 10% = $66,690 CCA \nAnd so on for the following years. \nStraight-line method – The capital cost of an asset other \nthan an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, or a \nproperty to which the immediate expensing was applied, is \n$780,000. The asset’s life expectancy is 10 years and the \nhalf-year rule does not apply. Therefore, the capital cost \nallowance will be $78,000 per year ($780,000 ÷ 10). \n \nClass 13 (property that is a leasehold interest) uses the \nstraight-line method (with the half-year rule for property \nacquired before November 21, 2018). \nAn accelerated investment incentive applies to class 13 for \nproperty acquired after November 20, 2018. See Accelerated \ninvestment incentive property on page 48. \nIf a disposition of all leasehold interests in class 13 occurs \nduring the amortization period, the terminal loss is claimed \nin the year it occurs if the lessee does not acquire a \ndepreciable property that is a leasehold interest before the \nend of the year. \nFor more information on the half-year rule, see Income Tax \nFolio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance. \nColumn 21 – Recapture of CCA \nEnter the amount of recapture from column 10, if \napplicable.

The accelerated CDE \nor COGPE does not include expenses incurred by a \npredecessor corporation that a successor corporation is \nentitled to claim. It also does not include an expense that is \na cost for Canadian resource property you, or a partnership \nin which you are a member, acquired from a person or \npartnership with which you do not deal at arm’s length. \nThe incentive will be phased out for expenses made \nafter 2023.

This means you can no longer \nrenounce oil, gas and coal exploration or development \nexpenditures to a flow-through share investor. This \napplies to expenditures under flow-through share \nagreements entered into after March 31, 2023. \nThe Fall Economic Statement 2018 introduced an \naccelerated rate for Canadian development expenses (CDE) \nthat a flow-through share (FTS) investor receives from a \nprincipal business corporation. This tax measure applies to \naccelerated CDE renounced under FTS agreements entered \ninto after November 20, 2018, for CDE incurred after the \nagreement date and before 2028. \nA principal business corporation needs to inform the \ninvestor that the renounced amount meets the above \nconditions in order for the investor to benefit from the \npermissive accelerated rate for these renounced expenses. \nIf you have invested in an FTS after November 20, 2018, \nand have received a statement of resource expenses from a \nprincipal business corporation, you may generally \nclaim CDE at the rate of 45% in the tax year in which they \nare renounced to you and, thereafter, at a rate of 30%.

        "text": "canada.ca/taxes \n76\nActive business income \nGenerally, active business income is income earned from a \nbusiness source, including any income incidental to the \nbusiness. \nIncome from a specified investment business or from a \npersonal services business, and income described in \nsubparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of specified corporate \nincome in subsection 125(7) for the year are generally not \nconsidered active business income and are not eligible for \nthe SBD. The following three sections explain when income \nfrom these types of businesses may be considered active \nbusiness income and eligible for the SBD. \nSpecified investment business \nA specified investment business is a business with the \nprincipal purpose of deriving income from property, \nincluding interest, dividends, rents, or royalties. It also \nincludes a business carried on by a prescribed \nlabour-sponsored venture capital corporation, the principal \npurpose of which is to derive income from property. \nExcept for a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital \ncorporation, income from a specified investment business is \nconsidered to be active business income, and is therefore \neligible for the SBD if: \n■ the corporation employs more than five full-time \nemployees in the business throughout the year, or \n■ an associated corporation provides managerial, financial, \nadministrative, maintenance, or other similar services to \nthe corporation while carrying on an active business, and \nthe corporation would have to engage more than \nfive full-time employees to perform these services if the \nassociated corporation were not providing them \nNote \nThe business a credit union carries on, or the business of \nleasing property other than real property, is not \nconsidered specified investment business. \nPersonal services business \nA personal services business is a business that a \ncorporation carries on to provide services to another entity \n(such as a person or a partnership) that an officer or \nemployee of that entity would usually perform. Instead, an \nindividual performs the services on behalf of the \ncorporation. That individual is called an incorporated \nemployee. \nAny income the corporation derives from providing the \nservices is considered income from a personal services \nbusiness, as long as both of the following conditions are \nmet: \n■ the incorporated employee who is performing the \nservices, or any person related to him or her, is a \nspecified shareholder of the corporation \n■ the incorporated employee would, if it were not for the \nexistence of the corporation, reasonably be considered an \nofficer or employee of the entity receiving the services \nHowever, if the corporation employs more than \nfive full-time employees throughout the year or provides \nthe services to an associated corporation, the income is not \nconsidered to be from a personal services business. \nTherefore, the income is eligible for the SBD. \nDeductions in computing income for a personal services \nbusiness are restricted to the following: \n■ salary, wages, or other remuneration of the incorporated \nemployee \n■ cost of other benefits or allowances provided to the \nincorporated employee \n■ certain expenses of the corporation associated with \nselling property or negotiating contracts \n■ legal expenses paid in the year by the corporation in \ncollecting amounts owed for services rendered \nNote \nAny expenses denied must be added back on Schedule 1. \nFor more information on the factors to take into account \nwhen a person is considered an employee, see \nGuide RC4110, Employee or self-employed? or go \nto canada.ca/cpp-ei-rulings. \nReference \nParagraph 18(1)(p) \nSpecified corporate income \nGenerally, where a CCPC earns income that would \notherwise be considered as income from an active business \nfrom providing property or services to another private \ncorporation and it (or one of its shareholders) or a person \nwho does not deal at arm’s length with the CCPC (or one of \nits shareholders) holds a direct or indirect interest in that \nother private corporation, the income would not be \nconsidered as being eligible for the SBD unless certain \nconditions are met. \nFor more information, see the definition of specified \ncorporate income in subsection 125(7). \nSpecified farming or fishing income \nThe definition of specified farming or fishing income \nreplaced the definition of specified cooperative income, \nwhich has been retroactively repealed. The definition of \nspecified corporate income excludes specified farming or \nfishing income, so that such income stays eligible for the \nSBD by default. \nSpecified farming or fishing income, of a corporation for a \ntax year, means income of the corporation (other than an \namount included in its income under subsection 135(7), \npatronage dividends), if both of the following conditions \nare met: \n■ the income is from the sale of the farming products or \nfishing catches of the corporation’s farming or fishing \nbusiness to another corporation \n■ the corporation deals at arm’s length with the other \ncorporation \nThis approach eliminates the requirement that sales have to \nbe to a farming or fishing cooperative corporation in order \nto be excluded from specified corporate income.",

The CRA can reassess beyond the \nnormal reassessment period for this specific purpose. \nYou will find information on how to request a \nreassessment on page 21. \nSpecified shareholder \nA specified shareholder is a taxpayer who owns, directly or \nindirectly at any time in the year, at least 10% of the issued \nshares of any class of capital stock of the corporation or a \nrelated corporation. \nHow to calculate income from an active business \ncarried on in Canada \nGenerally, to calculate active business income from \ncarrying on a business in Canada, you have to deduct from \nnet income for income tax purposes any of the following \namounts that apply: \n■ taxable capital gains minus allowable capital losses \n■ dividends that are deductible from income under \nsections 112 and 113, and subsection 138(6) \n■ property income minus property losses \n■ property income from an interest in a trust \n■ foreign business income \n■ income from a specified investment business \n■ income from a personal services business \n■ income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition \nof specified corporate income in subsection 125(7) for the \nyear where certain conditions are not met \nSpecified partnership income \nA corporation that is a member (or a designated member) \nof a partnership has to complete Schedule 7 to calculate its \nactive business income. \nThe specified partnership income rules impose a limit on \nthe amount of active business income earned by a \ncorporation as a member or designated member of a \npartnership that is eligible for the SBD. The eligible amount \nis referred to as specified partnership income and is added \nto the corporation’s active business income from other \nsources, if any. \nFor members of a partnership, their specified partnership \nbusiness limit is normally their pro-rata share of a notional \n$500,000 business limit for the partnership. \nFor designated members of a partnership, their specified \npartnership business limit is nil, unless they get an amount \nassigned from a member of the partnership. \nIf the partnership incurs a loss from carrying on an active \nbusiness, you have to deduct the corporation’s share of that \nloss from its active business income. This is referred to as a \nspecified partnership loss. \nIf your corporation is a member of a partnership in respect \nof which it filed a Schedule 73, you have to add or deduct \nthe total active business income determined under \nsection 34.2. \nIf the corporation received an information slip T5013, \nStatement of Partnership Income, that shows its share of \npartnership income or loss, keep it in case the CRA asks for \nit later. Do not include this form with the return.

The calculation \neffectively requires a private corporation to get a refund \nfrom its NERDTOH account before it gets a refund from \nits ERDTOH account, when it pays a non-eligible dividend. \nNote \nTo claim a dividend refund or to apply the amount to \nanother debit for any tax year, including the same tax \nyear, you have to file your income tax return within \nthree years of the end of the tax year. If your income tax \nreturn is not filed within three years of the end of the tax \nyear, the dividend refund becomes statute-barred, and \nwill not be issued. \nA dividend refund may arise if you pay taxable dividends \nto shareholders, and if there is an amount of NERDTOH \nor ERDTOH at the end of the tax year. Taxable dividends \npaid include the following: \n■ stock dividends \n■ section 84 deemed dividends \n■ amounts paid as interest or dividends on income bonds \nor debentures that are not deductible when calculating \nincome \nTo claim a dividend refund, you must make an actual \npayment to the shareholders unless the dividend is \nconsidered paid (a deemed dividend). This payment can be \neither in cash or with some other tangible assets. In the \nlatter case, the amount of the dividend is the fair market \nvalue of the asset transferred. \nA private or subject corporation may be entitled to a \ndividend refund for dividends it paid while it was a private \nor subject corporation, regardless of whether it was a \nprivate or subject corporation at the end of the tax year.

These methods are outlined in parts 1 and 2 \nof Schedule 27. \nNote \nThe new reduced tax rate for zero-emission technology \napplies only to the corporation’s zero-emission \ntechnology manufacturing profits, defined in \nsubsection 125.2(2) of the Act. These profits are equal to \nthe corporation’s adjusted business income multiplied \nby the proportion of its total labour and capital cost that \nare used in zero emission technology manufacturing. \nSmall manufacturing corporations only have to complete \nPart 1 of Schedule 27 and are entitled to calculate the MPPD \non their entire adjusted business income. Essentially, a \ncorporation’s adjusted business income is its income from \nan active business it carried on in Canada that is more than \nits losses from similar businesses. If the corporation is \ninvolved in resource activities, it has to reduce the adjusted \nbusiness income by its net resource income, its refund \ninterest, and part of its prescribed resource loss. \nSchedule 27 shows how to calculate the adjusted business \nincome. \nTo qualify as a small manufacturing corporation, you have \nto meet all of the following requirements: \n■ the activities during the year were mainly manufacturing \nor processing \n■ the active business income and that of any associated \nCanadian corporations was not more than $200,000 \n■ you were not engaged in any activities specifically \nexcluded from manufacturing and processing, as defined \nin subsection 125.1(3), such as farming, fishing, logging, \nconstruction, operating an oil or gas well or extracting",

A penalty applies for late filing of Schedule 56 in \naddition to the penalty applicable to late filing of the \nT2 Return. \nOn line 705, enter the amount of Part II.2 tax payable that \nyou determined at amount G of Schedule 56. \nLine 710 – Part III.1 tax payable \nA corporation that designates dividends as eligible \ndividends that exceed its capacity to pay such dividends is \nsubject to Part III.1 tax. The tax is equal to 20% of the \nexcessive eligible dividend designation. \nUse Schedule 55, Part III.1 Tax on Excessive Eligible Dividend \nDesignations, to calculate any Part III.1 tax payable and file \nit with your T2 return. \nNote \nEvery corporation resident in Canada that pays a taxable \ndividend in the year, other than a capital gains dividend, \nmust file this schedule. \nIn the case where an excessive eligible dividend \ndesignation is determined to be part of a tax avoidance \nscheme, the 20% tax plus an additional 10% tax will apply \nto the whole dividend designation. \nEligible dividend \nAn eligible dividend is any taxable dividend paid to a \nresident of Canada by a Canadian corporation that is \ndesignated by that corporation to be an eligible dividend. \nThe corporation does the designation by notifying, in \nwriting, each person or partnership at the time it pays them \nthe dividend. For more information about the notification \nguidelines, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends and \nselect “Designation of eligible dividends.” \nA corporation is allowed to designate a portion of a taxable \ndividend (rather than the whole amount) to be an eligible \ndividend. Late designations are allowed, if they are made \nwithin three years, or in some situations, six years, after the \nday on which the designation was first required to be made \nand, in the opinion of the minister, it is just and equitable to \ndo so (including to affected shareholders) in the \ncircumstances. The designation is deemed to have been \nmade on the day the designation was required to be made. \nA corporation’s capacity to pay eligible dividends depends \nmostly on its status. \nGeneral rate income pool (GRIP) \nA CCPC or a deposit insurance corporation may pay \neligible dividends to the extent of its GRIP—a balance \ngenerally reflecting taxable income that has not benefited \nfrom the small business deduction or any other special tax \nrate—without incurring Part III.1 tax. The GRIP is \ncalculated at the end of the tax year. However, a \ncorporation can pay eligible dividends over the course of \nthe year as long as, at the end of the year, the eligible \ndividends paid do not exceed its GRIP. \nUse Schedule 53, General Rate Income Pool (GRIP) \nCalculation, to determine the GRIP and file it with your \nT2 return. You should file this schedule if you paid an \neligible dividend in the tax year, or if your GRIP balance \nchanged, to ensure that the GRIP balance on CRA’s records \nis correct. \nYou can view GRIP balances using the “View return \nbalances” service through: \n■ My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business \n-account, if you are the business owner \n■ Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if \nyou are an authorized representative or employee \nLow rate income pool (LRIP) \nA corporation resident in Canada that is neither a CCPC \nnor a deposit insurance corporation can pay eligible \ndividends in any amount unless it has an LRIP. \nNote \nFor tax years starting after April 6, 2022, the investment \nincome earned by substantive CCPCs will be added to \ntheir LRIP so that distributions of such income will not \nentitle the shareholders to the enhanced dividend tax \ncredit.",

The \ncorporation has to reduce its LRIP to zero by paying out \nordinary dividends before it can pay an eligible dividend, \nor it will be subject to Part III.1 tax. The LRIP must be \ncalculated at the time a dividend is paid or received or any \nother event occurs affecting the LRIP balance in the year. \nUse Schedule 54, Low Rate Income Pool (LRIP) Calculation, to \ndetermine the LRIP, throughout the year. File the \ncompleted schedule with your T2 return. All other \ncalculations including the worksheets should be kept with \nyour records in case the CRA asks for them at a later date. \nElection not to be a Canadian-controlled private \ncorporation \nA CCPC can elect not to be a CCPC for purposes of the \neligible dividend treatment. If it so elects, it is deemed not \nto be a CCPC for the tax year in which it makes the election \nand all later tax years, until it revokes the election. The \nCCPC will lose its entitlement to the small business \ndeduction. However, no other benefits of CCPC status will \nbe affected. \nA corporation that revokes an election will become a CCPC \nagain for the tax year that follows the tax year in which the \nrevocation is made. \nUse Form T2002, Election, or Revocation of an Election, not to \nBe a Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation, to make or to \nrevoke an election previously made, and file it by the due \ndate of the T2 return. The CRA will not accept an election \nor revocation of an election after the filing due date. \nNote \nA corporation that has previously revoked an election \nmust get written consent from the CRA to make or \nrevoke another election. \nElection to treat excessive eligible dividend \ndesignations as ordinary dividends \nCorporations that make excessive eligible dividend \ndesignations may be allowed to elect to treat the excessive \namounts paid as ordinary dividends. In order to do so, the \ncorporation must have the concurrence of its shareholders \nwho received, or were entitled to receive, the dividend and \nwhose addresses are known to the corporation. For more \ninformation, go to canada.ca/taxes-eligible-dividends and \nselect “Election to treat excessive eligible dividend \ndesignations as ordinary dividends.” \nCorporations cannot elect to treat excessive eligible \ndividend designations that are subject to the 30% Part III.1 \ntax as ordinary dividends. \nReferences \nSections 185.1 and 185.2 \nSubsections 89(11) to (14) \nLine 712 – Part IV tax payable \nUse Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3, Dividends Received, Taxable \nDividends Paid, and Part IV Tax Calculation, to calculate \nPart IV tax payable on taxable dividends you received. \nDividends subject to Part IV tax \nThe following types of dividends are subject to Part IV tax: \n■ taxable dividends from corporations that are deductible \nunder section 112 when you calculate taxable income \n■ taxable dividends from foreign affiliates that are \ndeductible under paragraphs 113(1)(a), (a.1) (b), or (d), or \nsubsection 113(2) when you calculate taxable income \nNote \nFor details about dividends received after 2023 by \nfinancial institutions on shares that are mark-to-market \nproperty, see Line 320 on page 72. \nTaxable dividends received are only subject to Part IV tax \nif the corporation receives them while it is a private or \nsubject corporation.

Each corporate \npartner in a partnership has a permanent establishment \nwhere the partnership has a fixed place of business.

This applies to \nboth general and limited partners. For example, where a \ncorporation or its partnership uses substantial machinery or \nequipment in a particular place at any time in a tax year, it \nis deemed to have a permanent establishment in that place. \nReview the locations in which your activities and \ntransactions occur to ensure all permanent establishments \nare properly identified. \nIf the corporation carries on business, including partnership \nbusiness, through an employee or an agent established in a \nparticular place, it is considered to have a permanent \nestablishment in that place if the employee or agent: \n■ has general authority to contract for the corporation, or \n■ has a stock of merchandise owned by the corporation \nfrom which the employee or agent regularly fills orders \nreceived \nA corporation that would not otherwise have any \npermanent establishment in a province or territory and/or \na jurisdiction outside of Canada is deemed to have a \npermanent establishment at the place designated in its \nincorporation documents or bylaws as its head office or \nregistered office.

If there is no taxable income, \nyou only have to complete columns A, B and D. \nNote \nThis also applies to corporations with permanent \nestablishments in Quebec or Alberta. \nThe CRA assesses provincial or territorial income taxes on \nthe amount of taxable income allocated to each province or \nterritory. For details on how to allocate taxable income, see \nRegulation 402 and Income Tax Folio S4-F3-C2, Provincial \nIncome Allocation. \nSpecial rules for establishing a corporation’s gross revenue \nand salaries and wages attributable to a jurisdiction are \nprovided in cases where the corporation is a member of a \npartnership and the partnership had permanent \nestablishments in more than one jurisdiction. See \nGuide T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return \n(T5013 Forms), and prescribed Form T5013 SCH 5, Allocation \nof Salaries and Wages, and Gross Revenue for Multiple \nJurisdictions – Schedule 5. \nWhether or not the partnership filed a T5013 and related \nschedules, the partner corporations must report their \npermanent establishments and allocable revenue and \nsalaries and wages on their own Schedule 5, inclusive of \ntheir partnership allocations. If a partner has a 50% share of \npartnership income it must include 50% of the gross \nrevenue from T5013 SCH 5 in its T2 SCH 5 gross revenue. \nSalaries and wages of the partnership should also be \nreported on the T2 SCH 5 in the same proportions. \nGenerally, to allocate taxable income to each province or \nterritory, you have to use a formula based on gross \nrevenue, and salaries and wages. See Part 1 of Schedule 5 \nfor details. \nYou will find the general rules on how to allocate gross \nrevenue in Regulation 402. \nDo not include any of the following amounts in gross \nrevenue: \n■ interest on bonds, debentures, or mortgages \n■ dividends on shares of capital stock \n■ rents or royalties from property that are not part of the \nprincipal business operations \nAllocate gross salaries and wages paid in the year to the \npermanent establishment in which those salaries and wages \nwere paid only to the extent they were paid to employees of \nthe permanent establishment (the permanent establishment \nis not necessarily the permanent establishment in which \nthose salaries and wages were paid). Do not include in \ngross salaries and wages any commissions paid to a person \nwho is not an employee, unless that person renders services \nthat would normally be performed by an employee of the \ncorporation. The allocation of salaries paid through a \ncentral paymaster is subject to the deeming rules under \nRegulation 402.1. \nSee Regulations 403 to 413 for details on special methods \nfor allocating taxable income for the following types of \nbusinesses: \n■ insurance corporations (Regulation 403) \n■ banks (Regulation 404) \n■ federal credit unions (Regulation 404.1) \n■ trust and loan corporations (Regulation 405) \n■ railway corporations (Regulation 406) \n■ airline corporations (Regulation 407) \n■ grain elevator operators (Regulation 408)",

This credit reduces the \nprovincial tax otherwise payable. \nHowever, you cannot claim foreign tax credits for the \nprovinces of Quebec and Alberta on the federal return \nbecause these provinces collect their own income taxes. \nThe provincial or territorial foreign tax credit is available to \na corporation that meets all of the following criteria: \n■ it is resident in Canada throughout the tax year \n■ it has a permanent establishment in the province or \nterritory at any time in the tax year \n■ it has foreign investment income for the tax year \nFor Ontario, an authorized foreign bank is eligible for the \nforeign tax credit if it performed Canadian banking \nbusiness. \nYou can claim this credit only if the foreign non-business \nincome tax paid exceeds the federal foreign non-business \nincome tax credit deductible for the year. \nFor each province or territory for which you are claiming a \ncredit, you have to do a separate calculation. Also, if you \npaid tax to more than one foreign country you have to do a \nseparate calculation for each country. \nIf dual rates of corporation tax apply, use the higher rate \nwhen you calculate the foreign tax credit. For Ontario, use \nthe basic rate of tax. \nTo claim the foreign tax credit, complete Schedule 21, \nFederal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits \nand Federal Logging Tax Credit. \nNote \nIf the tax rate has changed during the tax year, you have \nto prorate the calculation in Part 9 of Schedule 21 using \nthe number of days in each period. For British Columbia, \nprorate the tax rate in each period, round off the \nprorated rates to the nearest one-thousandth of \none percent (= 0.001%), and add the rounded \npercentages for the periods before multiplying by the \nforeign non-business income. \nOn the appropriate lines of Part 2 of Schedule 5, enter the \napplicable provincial and territorial foreign tax credits. \nNewfoundland and Labrador \nThe lower rate of Newfoundland and Labrador income tax \nis 3%.

If the rate changes during the \ntax year, you have to base your calculation on the number \nof days in the year that each rate is in effect. \nThe higher rate of income tax is 15%. This higher rate \napplies to taxable income earned in Newfoundland and \nLabrador that does not qualify for the federal small \nbusiness deduction. \nThese rates also apply to taxable income earned in the \nNewfoundland and Labrador offshore area. \nYou can use Schedule 307, Newfoundland and Labrador \nCorporation Tax Calculation, to help you calculate the \nNewfoundland and Labrador tax before the credits are \napplied.

It is \ncalculated by multiplying the corporation’s Ontario small \nbusiness income for the tax year by the small business \ndeduction rate (8.3%) for the year, resulting in a lower \ntax rate of 3.2%. \nThe Ontario small business deduction is phased out for \nCCPCs (including associated corporations) with taxable \ncapital employed in Canada of more than $10 million in the \nprevious tax year. It is completely eliminated when the \ntaxable capital is $50 million or more in the previous \ntax year. For tax years starting before April 7, 2022, the \namount was $15 million. This is referred to as the taxable \ncapital business limit reduction. \nThe Ontario small business limit is not subject to the federal \npassive income business limit reduction. As such, eligible \nOntario small businesses can receive the Ontario small \nbusiness deduction regardless of the amount of passive \nincome they earned. See page 78. \nNote \nOntario small business income cannot exceed Ontario \ntaxable income. \nWhen calculating the Ontario small business income, the \ncorporation’s Ontario domestic factor is the ratio of the \ncorporation’s Ontario taxable income to the corporation’s \ntaxable income earned in all provinces and territories. \nYou can use Part 2 of Schedule 500, Ontario Corporation Tax \nCalculation, to calculate the deduction. Schedule 500 is a \nworksheet and you do not have to file it with your return. \nOn line 402 of Schedule 5, enter the small business \ndeduction amount. \nOntario transitional tax debits and credits \nThe Ontario transitional tax debits and credits have \nprovided a transition from the Corporations Tax Act \n(Ontario) for corporations with different income tax \nattributes for federal and Ontario purposes. \nFor tax years ending before 2009, a corporation’s income \nand taxable income for Ontario purposes were determined \nbased on its Ontario tax pools (for example, the \nundepreciated capital cost of depreciable property) under \nthe Corporations Tax Act (Ontario). \nFor tax years ending after 2008, the corporation’s income \nand taxable income for Ontario purposes are determined \nbased on its federal tax pools under the Taxation Act, 2007 \n(Ontario). \nIf the corporation’s federal tax pools exceeded its Ontario \ntax pools, the corporation had a transitional tax debit. A \nspecified corporation subject to the Ontario transitional tax \ndebit was generally required to pay additional Ontario \ncorporate income tax over a five-year period beginning \nwith its first tax year ending after 2008. \nAlthough the five-year period has ended, it is still possible \nto have a transitional tax debit since, after 2015, the \ncorporation can continue to defer the transitional tax debits \nas long as it does not claim an SR&ED tax deduction and \nthe SR&ED expenditure pool is not reduced by government \nassistance. \nConversely, where the corporation’s Ontario tax pools \nexceeded its federal tax pools, the corporation had a \ntransitional tax credit. A specified corporation was \ngenerally entitled to a transitional tax credit over a five-year \nperiod beginning with its first tax year ending after 2008. \nYou can no longer claim this credit. \nA specified corporation is defined under subsection 46(5) of \nthe Taxation Act, 2007 (Ontario). \nComplete Schedule 506, Ontario Transitional Tax Debits and \nCredits, to calculate the corporation’s transitional tax debits. \nUse Schedule 507, Ontario Transitional Tax Debits and Credits \nCalculation, to determine the amounts to enter in Part 3 of \nSchedule 506. \nFile Schedule 506 with the return. Schedule 507 does not \nhave to be filed with the return. \nOn line 276 of Schedule 5, enter the total transitional tax \ndebits. \nOntario corporate minimum tax \nThe Ontario corporate minimum tax payable is equal to the \namount by which the corporate minimum tax exceeds the \nOntario corporate income tax. \nA corporation is subject to corporate minimum tax if its \ntotal assets are $50 million or more and its total revenue is \n$100 million or more except if the corporation was, \nthroughout the tax year, one of the following: \n■ a corporation exempt from income tax under section 149 \nof the federal Income Tax Act \n■ a mortgage investment corporation \n■ a deposit insurance corporation under \nsubsection 137.1(5) of the federal Income Tax Act \n■ a congregation or business agency to which section 143 of \nthe federal Income Tax Act applies \n■ an investment corporation \n■ a mutual fund corporation \nThe corporate minimum tax rate is 2.7%. \nIn determining if the total assets or total revenue exceeds \nthe limits, a corporation must include its share of the total \nassets and total revenue of a partnership in which it has an \ninterest, any associated foreign or Canadian corporation, \nand any associated corporation’s share of a partnership. \nIf a corporation is associated it must complete and file \nSchedule 511, Ontario Corporate Minimum Tax – Total Assets \nand Revenue for Associated Corporations, to report the \ntotal assets and total revenue of all the associated \ncorporations. \nFile Schedule 510, Ontario Corporate Minimum Tax, with \nyour T2 return if one of the following applies: \n■ the corporation is subject to corporate minimum tax for \nthe tax year (Part 1 of the schedule) \n■ the corporation is not subject to corporate minimum tax \nin the year, but is deducting a corporate minimum tax \ncredit or has a corporate minimum tax credit",
