## Recapture of Ontario Research and Development Tax Credit

### Overview
A corporation that disposed of property used in scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED), or converted it to commercial use, must report a recapture of any Ontario research and development tax credit previously calculated on that property.

### Implementation Details
- Any recapture will create or increase Ontario tax otherwise payable
- Calculate the recapture by completing Schedule 508, Ontario Research and Development Tax Credit
- Enter the recapture amount on line 277 of Schedule 5

### Example
If a corporation claimed $50,000 in Ontario R&D tax credits on equipment that was later sold for commercial use, they may need to recapture a portion of those credits, which would increase their Ontario tax payable.
