  "enhanced_content": "## Part 8 – Election under paragraph 88(1.1)(f)\nThis section covers the election provision that allows taxpayers to make specific tax elections related to corporate reorganizations and certain transactions. Developers should note that this election requires specific form filing and timing considerations.\n\n## Taxable Income\nTaxable income represents the amount after all deductions have been applied to net income. It serves as the basis for calculating federal and provincial/territorial taxes. For developers, this is a critical calculation that must account for all applicable deductions and adjustments.\n\n### Line 300 – Net Income or (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes\nThis line represents the taxpayer's total income less allowable deductions before applying tax credits. It's calculated by:\n- Summing all sources of income (employment, business, investment, etc.)\n- Subtracting eligible deductions (RRSP contributions, child care expenses, etc.)\n\nExample: If a taxpayer has $80,000 in employment income, $5,000 in investment income, and $15,000 in eligible deductions, their net income would be $70,000 ($80,000 + $5,000 - $15,000).\n\n## Donation and Gift Credits (Lines 311-314)\nThese lines cover various donation and gift credits that provide tax benefits for charitable giving.\n\n### Line 311 – Charitable Donations\nThis line captures donations made to registered charities and other qualified donees. The credit is calculated as:\n- 15% on the first $200 of annual donations\n- 29% on donations exceeding $200 (33% for high-income earners)\n\nExample: A taxpayer who donates $1,000 to registered charities would receive a credit of $15 on the first $200 and $232 on the remaining $800, for a total credit of $247.\n\n### Line 313 – Cultural Gifts\nThis line covers donations of cultural property to designated institutions. These gifts receive special treatment:\n- No capital gains tax on the disposition\n- Enhanced donation credit (same rates as charitable donations)\n- Potential for additional benefits through the Cultural Property Export and Import Act\n\nExample: An artist who donates a painting with a fair market value of $10,000 to a designated gallery would claim a $2,870 donation credit and pay no capital gains tax on the disposition.\n\n### Line 314 – Ecological Gifts\nThis line captures donations of ecologically sensitive land to qualified recipients. These gifts offer:\n- No capital gains tax on the disposition\n- Enhanced donation credit (same rates as charitable donations)\n- Potential for additional provincial benefits\n\nExample: A landowner who donates 50 acres of ecologically sensitive land worth $100,000 to a conservation authority would claim a $28,700 donation credit and pay no capital gains tax on the disposition.\n\n## Line 320 – Taxable Dividends Deductible Under\nThis line relates to the dividend gross-up and credit mechanism for Canadian dividends. It includes:\n- Eligible dividends (from corporations paying tax at the general corporate rate)\n- Non-eligible dividends (from corporations paying tax at the small business rate)\n\nThe calculation involves:\n1. Grossing up the dividend amount (38% for eligible, 15% for non-eligible)\n2. Applying the dividend tax credit (15.0198% for eligible, 9.0301% for non-eligible)\n\nExample: For a $1,000 eligible dividend:\n- Grossed-up amount: $1,380\n- Dividend tax credit: $207.27\n- Net taxable amount: $1,380 - $207.27 = $1,172.73",
