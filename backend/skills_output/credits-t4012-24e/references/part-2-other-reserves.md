## Patronage Dividend Deduction (Schedule 16)

### Calculation Process
Complete Parts 1, 2, and 3 of Schedule 16 to calculate the allowable patronage dividend deduction.

### Example

Members may elect to include amounts in income before disposition by submitting a letter with their return specifying the amount to be included.

## Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim (Form T661)

### Critical Deadlines
- File Form T661 and Schedule 31 within 12 months after the filing due date of the income tax return for the year in which expenditures were made
- Non-profit corporations must file by the filing due date to avoid late-filing penalties

### Example
A corporation with a December 31 year-end that files its return on March 31, 2023, must file Form T661 by March 31, 2024, to claim SR&ED expenditures for 2022.

### Penalties
- $1,000 penalty for incomplete or inaccurate claim preparer information
- Both corporation and claim preparer may be liable for the penalty

- Carried forward and deducted in any future year

### Reporting Requirements
- If SR&ED expenditures included in income statement → Line 118, Schedule 1
- SR&ED expenditures claimed in the year → Line 411, Schedule 1

### Partnership Considerations
When a corporation is a partnership member:
- Partnership files Form T661 with T5013 FIN and T5013 SUM
