### References in this guide

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Regulations of Canada, unless stated otherwise. This guide does not replace the Income Tax Act or its regulations.

This guide also refers to information circulars (ICs) and interpretation bulletins (ITs) that the CRA publishes to give you more technical information. A new series of technical publications, called the income tax folios, is progressively replacing the interpretation bulletins. This process is taking place over several years. To be notified of new or updated income tax folios, subscribe to the electronic mailing list at canada.ca/cra-email-lists.

Many of CRA's publications, including forms, schedules, ICs, ITs, and folios are available at canada.ca/cra-forms-publications. A table at the end of this guide lists forms by number.

### AgriStability and AgriInvest programs

The CRA is not involved in administering the AgriStability and AgriInvest programs for corporations. For more information on these programs, go to agr.gc.ca/agristability and agr.gc.ca/agriinvest.

### CRA's service pledge

The CRA will process 95% of T2 corporation income tax returns filed electronically within 45 days.

### Find out if you have to file a T2 return

#### Resident corporations

All corporations—including non-profit organizations, tax-exempt corporations, and inactive corporations—have to file a T2 return for every tax year, even if there is no tax payable. The only exceptions to this rule are tax-exempt Crown corporations, Hutterite colonies, and corporations that were registered charities throughout the year.

#### Non-resident corporations

A non-resident corporation has to file a T2 return if, at any time in the year, one of the following situations applies:

- it carried on business in Canada
- it had a taxable capital gain
- it disposed of taxable Canadian property, unless the disposition meets all the criteria listed below in the section "Dispositions of taxable Canadian property (certificates of compliance)"

This requirement applies even if the corporation claims that any profits or gains realized are exempt from Canadian income tax due to the provisions of a tax treaty.

Business is defined in subsection 248(1) and the extended meaning of carrying on business (in Canada) is defined in section 253.

The references to taxable capital gain do not include any gain resulting from the disposition of shares that are listed on a designated stock exchange (other than taxable Canadian property).

A non-resident corporation also has to file a T2 return in a number of situations, including:

- when it has filed Form NR6, Undertaking to File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real or Immovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty, to pay Part I tax on the net amount of timber royalty income or rental income from real property under subsection 216(4) for the current year and the CRA approved it
- when it has filed Form T1288, Application by a Non-Resident of Canada (Corporation) for a Reduction in the Amount of Non-Resident Tax Required to Be Withheld on Income Earned from Acting in a Film or Video Production, to pay Part I tax on the net amount of acting services under subsection 216.1(1) for the current year and the CRA approved it

Even if neither of these requirements applies, a non-resident corporation may still want to file a return if any of the following situations apply:

- when it wants to claim a refund
- when it wants to elect to pay Part I tax on the net amount of timber royalty income or rental income from real property under subsection 216(1) for the current year
- when it wants to elect to pay Part I tax on the net amount of acting services under subsection 216.1(1) for the current year

**Note:** Non-resident corporations must file their T2 return, schedules, and the General Index of Financial Information in Canadian funds only. They are not eligible to file in a functional currency per section 261.

If you have questions about non-resident returns, go to canada.ca/taxes-international-business.

#### Dispositions of taxable Canadian property (certificates of compliance)

A non-resident corporation that disposes of taxable Canadian property must notify the CRA and may be required to get a certificate of compliance under section 116. For details, see Information Circular IC72-17, Procedures Concerning the Disposition of Taxable Canadian Property by Non-residents of Canada – Section 116.

A non-resident corporation that has a taxable capital gain or disposed of taxable Canadian property, including a corporation that may have received a certificate of compliance from the CRA, has to file a return, unless the disposition meets all the following criteria:

- no tax is payable under Part I for the tax year
- the corporation is not liable to pay any amount under the Act for any previous tax year (other than an amount covered by adequate security under section 116 or 220)
- each taxable Canadian property disposed of in the tax year is one of the following:
  - excluded property under section 116
  - property for which a certificate was issued under section 116

canada.ca/taxes
11

Taxable Canadian property excludes shares of corporations, and certain other interests, that, during the 60-month period ending at the time of determination, do not derive their value principally from real or immovable property situated in Canada (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property).

#### Non-resident corporations claiming treaty exemption

If you carried on a treaty-protected business in Canada or disposed of a taxable Canadian property that was treaty-protected property during the year (as defined in section 248), you have to complete all of the following lines on your return:

- lines 001 to 082 of page 1
- lines 164, 170, and 171 of page 2
- lines 270 to 289 (except line 271) of page 3
- lines 780 to 990, if applicable, of page 9

For each of the questions asked at lines 164, 170, and 171 on page 2 of the return to which your response is yes, complete the appropriate form or schedule and attach it to your return. In addition, you have to complete Schedule 91, Information Concerning Claims for Treaty-Based Exemptions.

#### Rental income from Canada

Rental income from Canada is subject to a 25% withholding on the gross rental income under Part XIII, unless the rate is reduced by a reciprocal tax treaty. A non-resident corporation can elect to be taxed under Part I on its net rental income by filing a T2 return under subsection 216(1) within two years of the end of the tax year. If the non-resident corporation has filed Form NR6, Undertaking to File an Income Tax Return by a Non-Resident Receiving Rent from Real or Immovable Property or Receiving a Timber Royalty, it must file a T2 return under subsection 216(4) within six months of the tax year end. For more information, see IT393R2 – Election Re: Tax on Rents and Timber Royalties Non-Residents.

**Note:** If you file a T2 return under section 216, include only rental income. If you have any other income, file a second T2 return.

**Reference:** Guide T4144, Income Tax Guide for Electing Under Section 216

#### Services rendered in Canada (withholding amount)

A non-resident corporation is subject to a 15% withholding under Regulation 105 on any fee or other amount paid to it for services rendered in Canada (regardless of whether the services are provided by an employee of the corporation or are sub-contracted to another party). This withholding is held on account of any potential tax liability that the corporation may have to Canada. The corporation's tax liability is determined when its Canadian income tax return is assessed.

Effective on royal assent, the CRA would be able to waive this withholding requirement over a specified period if either of the following conditions were met:

- the non-resident is not subject to Canadian income tax for the payments because of a tax treaty between their country of residence and Canada
- the income from providing the services is exempt income from international shipping or from operating an aircraft in international traffic

The minister of National Revenue would have the legislative authority to waive the withholding requirement on multiple transactions with a single waiver, and to establish any conditions and information requirements necessary to reduce compliance risks.

The minister could also revoke the waiver if they are no longer satisfied that the conditions are being met.

A corporation related to a non-resident actor is subject to a 23% withholding tax under Part XIII on all amounts it receives for the acting services of the actor in a film or video production in Canada. This withholding tax represents the final tax liability for these acting services. The corporation may elect not to be taxed under Part XIII at the 23% rate by filing a return of income under Part I for the year. A non-resident corporation that has received a reduction (filed Form T1288) of this withholding tax from the CRA still has to file a return.

**Note:** Send your Canadian T2 return that you elected to file under section 216.1 to the tax services office that processed application Form T1288 and issued the reduction. Write "Actor's election" at the top of page 1 of the return.

**Reference:** Section 153

### How to file your return

#### Using tax preparation software

Over 90% of corporations file their return electronically. To do so, you must use CRA-certified software. The CRA certifies commercial software to ensure that it meets the CRA's specifications. To find a list of certified software, visit Canada.ca and search for "certified software corporations."

A return prepared by certified software can then be electronically filed using:

- the CRA's Corporation Internet Filing service
- My Business Account, at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account, if you are a business owner
- Represent a Client, at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if you are an authorized representative or employee

If you cannot file electronically, you can print the T2 Bar Code Return and mail it to the CRA.

**Note:** Do not send the T2 bar code by fax. The CRA does not accept it.

If you file through an electronic transmitter, you have to authorize the transmitter by completing Form T183 CORP, Information Return for Corporations Filing Electronically, for

canada.ca/taxes
12

each tax year. As of June 22, 2023, Form T183CORP may be signed with an electronic signature.

Do not send this form to the CRA, but keep it in case the CRA asks for it later.

#### T2 Auto-fill

T2 Auto-fill is a secure service that lets corporations and authorized representatives download information from the CRA to their tax preparation software. Using this service will ensure that certain return and account balances will match CRA's data. For more information on what T2 Auto-fill delivers, go to canada.ca/auto-fill-my-t2-return.

This service is not mandatory for certified software products. Some include it and others do not. If you have questions on the availability of the service, contact the software product company.

#### Mandatory electronic filing

All corporations with annual gross revenue of more than $1 million had to file their T2 return electronically, except for insurance corporations, non-resident corporations, corporations reporting in functional currency, and corporations that are exempt from tax payable under section 149 of the Income Tax Act.

This $1 million threshold was eliminated for tax years starting after 2023. Most corporations have to file their return electronically.

Corporations that do not file their returns electronically when required are subject to a penalty. For more information, see page 16.

**References:** Subsection 150.1(2.1), Regulation 205.1(2)

#### Corporation Internet Filing

You must use CRA-approved software that has been certified for Corporation Internet Filing. By filing electronically, you will receive immediate confirmation that the CRA has received your return, enjoy faster processing and refunds, save on mailing costs, and help the environment by using less paper.

The T2 Attach-a-doc service allows corporations to attach supporting documentation such as certificates when they file their T2 return or within 24 hours of filing. This service is not mandatory for certified software products. Some include it and others do not. If you have questions on the availability of the service, contact the software product company.

If you are filing your T2 return electronically, and you cannot use the T2 Attach-a-doc service to file your supporting documents with your return, send them to your tax centre (see "Where to file your paper return" on page 13).

When sending paper documents, clearly identify your corporation's name, business number, and the applicable tax year-end on the documents.

If you are filing an election that does not have a prescribed form or prescribed manner, include it with the notes to your financial statements on the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) to transmit the election electronically with your return, unless otherwise stated on a T2-related form.

For an up-to-date list of all special elections and returns that can be e-filed using commercial tax preparation software, go to canada.ca/cra-special-elections-and-returns.

For information on your eligibility, available software, and more, go to canada.ca/corporation-internet.

#### Filing without a web access code

You can file corporation returns online without a web access code using "Transmit a return" through:

- My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account, if you are the business owner
- Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if you are an authorized representative or employee

#### North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes

All certified tax preparation software for T2 returns uses self-identified NAICS codes.

NAICS codes are hierarchical numerical codes designed to provide common definitions and descriptions of our industries and business activities. NAICS codes are up to six digits long. The Government of Canada as well as the governments of the provinces and territories use the data provided by NAICS codes for economic analysis and fiscal policy responses.

The integration of NAICS codes into T2 commercial tax preparation software packages means that corporations have to pick their main revenue-generating business activity directly from a drop-down list or a simple search.

Active corporations that file their T2 returns either by Internet or on paper using 2D bar codes must choose the appropriate codes to describe their main revenue-generating business activity.

Corporations using the return available on Canada.ca do not have to enter a NAICS code.

**Avoid errors:** It is important that you select the most accurate business activity the first time, since the first year's code is carried forward to following years, allowing for a simple validation of the description when there is no change in the main business activity.

If you do not select the business activity, problems and errors will result when you prepare the T2 return to be transmitted electronically or printed in bar-coded format.

If you have any questions on selecting NAICS codes to describe your corporation's main revenue-generating business activity when filing your T2 return, call the Business Enquiries line at 1-800-959-5525.

#### Using the returns available on Canada.ca
