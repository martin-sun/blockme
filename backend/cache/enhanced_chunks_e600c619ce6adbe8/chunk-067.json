In such cases:\n- Use a separate line for each tax year of the payer corporation\n- Provide information according to each respective tax year\n\n### Taxable Dividends Deduction\nOn line 320 of the return, enter the amount of taxable dividends deductible from taxable income under:\n- Section 112\n- Subsections 113(2) and 138(6)\n- Paragraphs 113(1)(a), (a.1), (b), or (d)\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Multiple Payer Corporations\nCorporation A received dividends from three different corporations during the tax year:\n- $10,000 from Corporation B\n- $15,000 from Corporation C\n- $5,000 from Corporation D\n\nEach dividend amount requires a separate calculation in Part 1.\n\n#### Example 2: Different Tax Years\nCorporation X has a December 31 year-end and received dividends from Corporation Y, which has a March 31 year-end:\n- $8,000 received in January 2023 (from Corporation Y's 2022 tax year)\n- $12,000 received in July 2023 (from Corporation Y's 2023 tax year)\n\nThese dividends should be reported on separate lines according to Corporation Y's respective tax years.\n\n### Implementation Notes for Developers\nWhen building tax applications:\n1. Create separate calculation modules for each dividend source\n2. Implement functionality to handle different tax years for the same corporation\n3. Include validation to ensure all applicable tax sections and subsections are considered for line 320 calculations\n4. Design the interface to clearly distinguish between taxable and non-taxable dividends\n5. Provide clear categorization for dividends received from different tax years of the same corporation",
