## Part 4 – Restricted Farm Losses

### Current-Year Restricted Farm Loss

A restricted farm loss applies when your chief source of income is neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other subordinate source of income. In such cases, the deductible portion of your farming loss is limited to $17,500 per year.

**Implementation Note:** For tax applications, verify the taxpayer's primary income source before applying this restriction.

**Example:** 
If a taxpayer has a farming loss of $25,000 but their main source of income is employment (not farming), only $17,500 can be deducted as a restricted farm loss. The remaining $7,500 cannot be claimed in the current year.

**Form Entry:**
- Enter the restricted amount on line 410 of Schedule 4
- Add this amount to your income on line 233 of Schedule 1

**Note:** Farm losses allocated from a partnership may also be subject to this restriction.

- IT-232, Losses – Their Deductibility in the Loss Year or in Other Years

### Continuity of Restricted Farm Losses and Carryback

This section establishes the continuity of restricted farm losses and facilitates carrying back current-year restricted farm losses to prior years.

**Carryback and Carryforward Periods:**
- Current-year restricted farm losses can reduce farm income for the 20 following tax years
- They can also be carried back to the 3 previous tax years
- Losses expire after the carry-forward period

**Implementation Note:** Track the year of origin for each restricted farm loss to properly manage carryback and carryforward periods.

**Special Adjustments:**

#### Line 405 - Transferred Losses
This line captures restricted farm losses transferred from:
- A predecessor corporation after amalgamation
- A subsidiary after wind-up (where ≥90% of issued shares in each class were owned by the corporation just before wind-up)

**Calculation:** Unused restricted farm losses available at the end of the predecessor's tax year (ending just before amalgamation/wind-up) minus any expired amounts.

#### Line 440 - Debt Forgiveness Adjustment
This line accounts for debt forgiveness under section 80 that reduces the restricted farm losses balance. Losses must be reduced in the order established by section 80.

#### Line 450 - Other Adjustments
This line captures adjustments for corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control, where losses accrued before the acquisition are not deductible afterward.

**Example:** 
If a corporation with $10,000 of restricted farm losses undergoes an acquisition of control, these losses may need to be adjusted on line 450 if they are no longer deductible.

**Closing Balance:**
The result of this section is the closing balance of restricted farm losses to carry forward to future years (line 480).

**Next Steps:**
Complete Part 6 to establish the balance of restricted farm losses by year of origin.
