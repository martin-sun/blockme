  "enhanced_content": "## T2 Corporation Income Tax Return: Overview of Tax Credits\n\nThe information provided on the Identification page (T2 Page 1) establishes the foundational data for the entire tax return, including the corporation's name, Business Number (BN), fiscal year-end, and corporation type (e.g., CCPC). These details are critical for determining eligibility and calculating the various tax credits available to a corporation.\n\nTax credits are amounts that reduce the tax a corporation owes. They are distinct from deductions, which reduce the amount of income on which tax is calculated. For developers building tax applications, it is essential to differentiate between the two primary categories of credits: non-refundable and refundable.\n\n### Non-Refundable Tax Credits\n\nNon-refundable tax credits are used to reduce the corporation's Part I tax payable. If the total of these credits exceeds the tax payable, the excess is not refunded; it is simply lost or can be carried back/forward, depending on the specific credit.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   Reduce federal and/or provincial tax payable to a minimum of zero.\n*   Cannot generate a tax refund.\n*   Calculated and applied on **Schedule 1 - Federal Tax Calculation** and the relevant provincial tax schedules.\n\n**Common Examples:**\n*   **General Rate Reduction (GRR):** A credit available to all corporations, reducing the general federal tax rate.\n*   **Small Business Deduction (SBD):** While technically a rate reduction, it functions similarly to a credit by lowering the tax rate on the first $500,000 of active business income for qualifying CCPCs. The application logic is tied to the \"taxable income\" and \"adjusted business income\" fields.\n*   **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC):** A credit for taxes paid to a foreign country on foreign-source income, intended to prevent double taxation. Calculated on **Schedule T2SCH4 - Foreign Tax Credit**.\n*   **Dividend Tax Credit:** A credit for dividends received from other taxable Canadian corporations.\n\n**Developer Action Item:** When processing non-refundable credits, your application's logic must first calculate the total Part I tax payable and then apply the sum of all eligible non-refundable credits. The final tax liability cannot be less than zero.\n\n### Refundable Tax Credits\n\nRefundable tax credits are more valuable as they not only reduce tax payable but can also result in a cash refund if the credit amount exceeds the tax liability.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   Reduce tax payable first.\n*   Any excess amount can be refunded to the corporation or applied against tax installments.\n*   Often calculated on dedicated schedules specific to the credit program.\n\n**Common Examples:**\n*   **Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Investment Tax Credit (ITC):** A significant incentive for R&D activities. The refundable portion depends on the corporation's size and the type of expenditure. Calculated on **Form T661 - Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim** and **Schedule T2SCH31**.\n*   **Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for other activities:** Credits for specific sectors like mining, renewable energy, and conservation. Also calculated on **Schedule T2SCH31**.\n*   **Refundable Portion of a CCPC's Dividend Tax Credit:** A portion of the dividend tax credit is refundable for eligible CCPCs.\n\n**Developer Action Item:** The calculation logic must first apply the credit against tax payable. If `credit_amount > tax_payable`, the result is a `refundable_amount = credit_amount - tax_payable`. This amount should be clearly identified as a potential refund or a reduction of future installments.\n\n### Practical Calculation Example\n\nConsider a Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation (CCPC) with the following simplified scenario:\n\n*   **Taxable Income:** $100,000 (all active business income)\n*   **Basic Federal Tax (15%):** $15,000\n*   **Small Business Deduction (SBD) Rate Reduction:** Reduces tax on first $500k to 9%. Effective tax rate is 9%.\n    *   *Recalculated Federal Tax:* $100,000 * 9% = $9,000\n*   **General Rate Reduction (GRR):** Assume a credit of $1,000 is available.\n*   **SR&ED Refundable ITC:** Assume a refundable credit of $5,000 is earned.\n\n**Calculation Flow:**\n\n1.  **Start with Tax Payable:** $9,000\n2.  **Apply Non-Refundable Credits:** $9,000 (Tax Payable) - $1,000 (GRR) = $8,000\n3.  **Apply Refundable Credits:** $8,000 (Tax Payable) - $5,000 (SR&ED ITC) = $3,000\n4.  **Final Result:**\n    *   **Federal Tax Payable:** $3,000\n    *   **Refundable Amount:** $0 (because the refundable credit did not exceed the remaining tax payable after non-refundable credits).\n\nIf the SR&ED credit was $12,000 instead:\n\n1.  **Start with Tax Payable:** $9,000\n2.  **Apply Non-Refundable Credits:** $9,000 - $1,000 = $8,000\n3.  **Apply Refundable Credits:** $8,000 - $12,000 = -$4,000\n4.  **Final Result:**\n    *   **Federal Tax Payable:** $0\n    *   **Refundable Amount:** $4,000",
