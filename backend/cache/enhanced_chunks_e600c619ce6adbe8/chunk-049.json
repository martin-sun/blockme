The SBD reduces Part I tax that the corporation would otherwise have to pay.\n\n#### Calculation Formula\nThe SBD is calculated as 19% of the lesser of:\n- Income from active business carried on in Canada (line 400)\n- Taxable income for the SBD (line 405)\n- Business limit (line 410)\n- Reduced business limit after assignments (line 428)\n\n#### Tax Rate Impact\nThe basic rate of Part I tax is 38% of taxable income, reduced to 28% after the federal tax abatement. With the SBD rate of 19%, the effective tax rate becomes 9% on eligible income.\n\n#### Example\nA CCPC has:\n- Active business income: $300,000\n- Taxable income: $350,000\n- Business limit: $500,000\n- Reduced business limit: $500,000\n\nThe SBD would be 19% of $300,000 (the lesser amount) = $57,000\n\n### Avoidance of the Business Limit and Taxable Capital Limit\n\n#### Associated Corporations Through a Third Corporation\nWhen two corporations (A and B) are associated with the same third corporation (C), but C has filed a Schedule 28 election to be deemed not associated with A and B for SBD purposes:\n\n- Investment income derived from Corp C that is deemed active business income under subsection 129(6) is not eligible for SBD and is taxed at the general corporate rate\n- Corps A and B remain associated with Corp C and must include Corp C's taxable capital limit when calculating their SBD\n\n### Preventing Multiplication of the Small Business Deduction\n\nTo prevent partnership structures from multiplying access to the SBD, specified partnership income rules apply to structures where:\n- A CCPC provides services or property to a partnership\n- The CCPC or a shareholder of the CCPC is a member of the partnership\n\nSimilar measures apply to corporate structures designed to multiply access to the SBD.\n\n## Line 400 – Income from Active Business Carried on in Canada\n\n### Calculation Process\nComplete Schedule 7, Aggregate Investment Income and Income Eligible for the Small Business Deduction, to determine:\n- Aggregate investment income and foreign investment income for the refundable portion of Part I tax\n- Specified partnership income for members (or designated members) of a partnership\n- Income from an active business carried on in Canada for the SBD\n\n### Business Limit Assignment\nCCPCs may assign all or part of their business limit under subsection 125(3.2) or specified partnership business limit under subsection 125(8) to another corporation.\n\n#### Requirements\n- Use Schedule 7 to assign all or part of your specified partnership business limit to another corporation\n- File Schedule 7 if another corporation assigned all or part of its business limit to your CCPC\n- File Schedule 7 if a member of a partnership assigned all or part of their specified partnership business limit to your CCPC\n- Report any business limit assignment on page 4 of the T2 return\n\n### Special Considerations\nIf claiming a deduction for patronage dividends on line 416 of Schedule 1, complete Part 5 of Schedule 16 to establish active business income carried on in Canada.\n\n## Active Business Income Definitions\n\n### General Definition\nActive business income is income earned from a business source, including any income incidental to the business.\n\n### Exclusions from Active Business Income\nThe following types of income are generally not considered active business income and are not eligible for the SBD:\n- Income from a specified investment business\n- Income from a personal services business\n- Income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of specified corporate income in subsection 125(7)\n\n### Specified Investment Business\nA specified investment business is a business with the principal purpose of deriving income from property, including interest, dividends, rents, or royalties.\n\n#### Exception for SBD Eligibility\nIncome from a specified investment business is considered active business income (and eligible for the SBD) if:\n- The corporation employs more than five full-time employees in the business throughout the year, or\n- An associated corporation provides managerial, financial, administrative, maintenance, or other similar services to the corporation while carrying on an active business, and the corporation would have to engage more than five full-time employees to perform these services if the associated corporation were not providing them\n\n#### Exclusions\nThe business a credit union carries on, or the business of leasing property other than real property, is not considered a specified investment business.\n\n### Personal Services Business\nA personal services business is a business that a corporation carries on to provide services to another entity that an officer or employee of that entity would usually perform, with an individual (incorporated employee) performing the services on behalf of the corporation.\n\n#### Conditions for Classification\nIncome is considered from a personal services business if both conditions are met:\n- The incorporated employee performing the services, or any person related to them, is a specified shareholder of the corporation\n- The incorporated employee would, if not for the existence of the corporation, reasonably be considered an officer or employee of the entity receiving the services\n\n#### Exception for SBD Eligibility\nThe income is not considered from a personal services business (and is eligible for the SBD) if:\n- The corporation employs more than five full-time employees throughout the year, or\n- The corporation provides the services to an associated corporation\n\n#### Deduction Restrictions\nFor a personal services business, deductions are restricted to:\n- Salary, wages, or other remuneration of the incorporated employee\n- Cost of other benefits or allowances provided to the incorporated employee\n- Certain expenses associated with selling property or negotiating contracts\n- Legal expenses paid in the year for collecting amounts owed for services rendered\n\nNote: Any expenses denied must be added back on Schedule 1.\n\n### Specified Corporate Income\nGenerally, where a CCPC earns income that would otherwise be considered active business income from providing property or services to another private corporation, and it (or its shareholders) or a non-arm's length person holds a direct or indirect interest in that other private corporation, the income would not be eligible for the SBD unless certain conditions are met.\n\n### Specified Farming or Fishing Income\nSpecified farming or fishing income of a corporation for a tax year means income from the sale of the corporation's farming products or fishing catches to another corporation, if:\n- The corporation deals at arm's length with the other corporation\n\nThis income is eligible for the SBD by default.\n\n#### Reassessment Request\nIf in a previous year (after March 21, 2016) you had income that meets the definition of specified farming or fishing income but did not meet the definition of specified cooperative income, you can request a reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period.\n\n### Specified Shareholder\nA specified shareholder is a taxpayer who owns, directly or indirectly at any time in the year, at least 10% of the issued shares of any class of capital stock of the corporation or a related corporation.\n\n## Calculating Income from Active Business Carried on in Canada\n\nTo calculate active business income from carrying on a business in Canada, deduct from net income for income tax purposes any of the following amounts that apply:\n- Taxable capital gains minus allowable capital losses\n- Dividends deductible from income under sections 112 and 113, and subsection 138(6)\n- Property income minus property losses\n- Property income from an interest in a trust\n- Foreign business income\n- Income from a specified investment business\n- Income from a personal services business\n- Income described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of specified corporate income in subsection 125(7) where certain conditions are not met\n\n## Specified Partnership Income\n\nA corporation that is a member (or designated member) of a partnership must complete Schedule 7 to calculate its active business income.\n\n### Limitation Rules\nThe specified partnership income rules limit the amount of active business income earned by a corporation as a member or designated member of a partnership that is eligible for the SBD. This eligible amount is referred to as specified partnership income.\n\n### Business Limit Allocation\n- For members of a partnership: Their specified partnership business limit is normally their pro-rata share of a notional $500,000 business limit for the partnership\n- For designated members: Their specified partnership business limit is nil, unless they receive an amount assigned from a member of the partnership\n\n### Partnership Losses\nIf the partnership incurs a loss from carrying on an active business, deduct the corporation's share of that loss from its active business income (referred to as a specified partnership loss).\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n- If the corporation is a member of a partnership in respect of which it filed a Schedule 73, add or deduct the total active business income determined under section 34.2\n- Keep the T5013, Statement of Partnership Income, showing the corporation's share of partnership income or loss, in case the CRA requests it (do not include this form with the return)\n\n## Line 405 – Taxable Income for the SBD\n\n### Calculation\nThe taxable income used to calculate the SBD is typically the amount entered on line 360. However, if you claimed a foreign non-business income tax credit, a foreign business income tax credit, or both, you must reduce the taxable income by:\n- 100/28 of the amount deductible as a federal foreign non-business income tax credit on line 632 (if that credit was determined without the refundable tax on the CCPC's investment income and without reference to the corporate tax reduction under section 123.4)\n- Four times the amount deductible as a federal foreign business income tax credit on line 636 (if that credit was determined without reference to the corporate tax reduction under section 123.4)\n\nAlso reduce taxable income by any amount that, because of federal law, is exempt from Part I tax.\n\n## Line 410 – Business Limit\n\n### Standard Limit\nThe maximum allowable business limit for a corporation not associated with any other corporation is $500,000.\n\n### Associated Corporations\nCCPCs associated with one or more corporations during the tax year must file Schedule 23, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Business Limit. On this schedule:\n- A percentage of the business limit is allocated to each corporation\n- The total of all percentages cannot exceed 100%\n\n### Special Considerations\n- If the tax year is shorter than 51 weeks, prorate the business limit based on the number of days in the tax year divided by 365\n- If a CCPC is associated with two other corporations and elects for the two other corporations not to be associated with each other for the purpose of the line 616 deduction, file Schedule 28, Election not to be Associated Through a Third Corporation\n\n## Line 426 – Reduced Business Limit\n\n### Reduction Calculation\nThe reduction in a CCPC's business limit is the greater of:\n- Taxable capital business limit reduction\n- Passive income business limit reduction\n\n### Taxable Capital Business Limit Reduction\n- CCPCs with taxable capital employed in Canada of $50 million or more do not qualify for the SBD\n- The business limit is reduced on a straight-line basis for CCPCs with taxable capital employed in Canada between $10 million and $50 million in the previous year\n  - For tax years starting before April 7, 2022, the range is $10 million to $15 million\n- Similar restrictions apply to any CCPC that is a member of an associated group with total taxable capital employed in Canada of more than $10 million\n\n#### Required Schedules\nIf your taxable capital employed in Canada is more than $10 million, file the appropriate schedule:\n- Schedule 33, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large Corporations\n- Schedule 34, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Financial Institutions\n- Schedule 35, Taxable Capital Employed in Canada – Large Insurance Corporations\n\n### Passive Income Business Limit Reduction\nThe business limit of a CCPC is reduced if the CCPC and any associated corporations earn combined passive investment income between $50,000 and $150,000. The business limit becomes nil once the combined passive investment income exceeds $150,000.\n\nThis income is calculated in Part 2 of Schedule 7 as the adjusted aggregate investment income.\n\n## Assignment of the Business Limit under Subsection 125(3.2)\n\nCCPCs can assign all or part of their business limit to another corporation.\n\n### Reporting Requirements\n- Enter the amount of the business limit you assign and the business number of the recipient corporation on page 4 of the T2 return\n- Deduct the assigned amount from line 426 and enter the result on line 428\n- If another corporation assigned all or part of its business limit to your CCPC, file Schedule 7\n\n## Line 430 – Small Business Deduction\n\n### Final Calculation\nMultiply the least of lines 400, 405, 410, and 428 by 19% to determine the Small Business Deduction.\n\nEnter the result on:\n- Line 430\n- Amount L on page 8 of the return\n\n### Example Calculation\nA CCPC has:\n- Line 400 (Active business income): $400,000\n- Line 405 (Taxable income for SBD): $350,000\n- Line 410 (Business limit): $500,000\n- Line 428 (Reduced business limit): $500,000\n\nThe SBD would be 19% of $350,000 (the lesser amount) = $66,500\n\nThis would be entered on line 430 and amount L on page 8 of the return.",
