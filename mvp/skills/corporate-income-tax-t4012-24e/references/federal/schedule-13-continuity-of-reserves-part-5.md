## Schedule 12, Resource-Related Deductions

You have to complete the appropriate parts of Schedule 12 if you are claiming any of the following deductions on Schedule 1:
- Canadian exploration expenses, including Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)
- Canadian development expenses
- Canadian oil and gas property expenses
- depletion
- foreign exploration and development expenses
- specified foreign exploration and development expenses
- foreign resource expenses

### Accelerated Investment Incentive

An accelerated investment incentive is available for eligible Canadian development expenses (CDE) and Canadian oil and gas property expenses (COGPE) incurred after November 20, 2018, and before 2028. The accelerated CDE or COGPE does not include expenses incurred by a predecessor corporation that a successor corporation is entitled to claim. It also does not include an expense that is a cost for Canadian resource property you, or a partnership in which you are a member, acquired from a person or partnership with which you do not deal at arm's length.

The incentive will be phased out for expenses made after 2023. For more information, go to canada.ca/taxes-accelerated-investment-income.

### Canadian Exploration Expenses and Canadian Development Expenses

**Note:** Eligible expenses related to lithium from brines made on or after March 28, 2023, qualify as Canadian exploration expenses and Canadian development expenses.

### Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expense

If most of the tangible property in a project is eligible for inclusion in class 43.1 or 43.2, certain intangible project start-up expenses (for example, engineering and design work, and feasibility studies) are treated as Canadian renewable and conservation expenses. You can generally deduct these expenses in full in the year you incurred them, carry them forward indefinitely for use in future years, or transfer them to investors using flow-through shares.

Schedule 12 gives details for the calculations required.

### Flow-Through Shares

**Note:** The flow-through share regime is eliminated for oil, gas, and coal activities. This means you can no longer renounce oil, gas and coal exploration or development expenditures to a flow-through share investor. This applies to expenditures under flow-through share agreements entered into after March 31, 2023.

The Fall Economic Statement 2018 introduced an accelerated rate for Canadian development expenses (CDE) that a flow-through share (FTS) investor receives from a principal business corporation. This tax measure applies to accelerated CDE renounced under FTS agreements entered into after November 20, 2018, for CDE incurred after the agreement date and before 2028.

A principal business corporation needs to inform the investor that the renounced amount meets the above conditions in order for the investor to benefit from the permissive accelerated rate for these renounced expenses.

If you have invested in an FTS after November 20, 2018, and have received a statement of resource expenses from a principal business corporation, you may generally claim CDE at the rate of 45% in the tax year in which they are renounced to you and, thereafter, at a rate of 30%. To calculate the amount of the CDE deduction you are entitled to claim, see Schedule 12.

## Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves

You have to complete Schedule 13 to show the continuity of deductible reserves. Indicate, on the appropriate lines, the prior-year and the current-year reserves as well as the reserve transferred from an amalgamation or wind-up. If your corporation or the predecessor corporation deducted a reserve amount last year, add that amount to current-year income and establish a new reserve amount.

### Part 1 – Capital Gains Reserves

Establish the continuity of reserves for each different property. Unlike other reserves, you have to report the total capital gain reserves that you and the predecessor corporation deducted last year. Add the current-year reserve on Schedule 6 to calculate the current-year capital gain. See page 42 for more details.

### Part 2 – Other Reserves

In this part, establish the continuity of the following reserves:
- reserve for doubtful debts
- reserve for undelivered goods and services not rendered (except for reclamation obligations)
- reserve for prepaid rent
- reserve for returnable containers
- reserve for unpaid amounts
- other tax reserves

Enter, on line 125 of Schedule 1, the total of the balance of your reserve at the beginning of the year (line 270 of Schedule 13) plus the amount of reserve transferred on wind-up/amalgamation (line 275 of Schedule 13).

Enter, on line 413 of Schedule 1, the balance at the end of the year (line 280 of Schedule 13).

**Note:** The balance at the beginning of the year of reserves from financial statements and the balance at the end of the year of reserves from financial statements should not be entered on Schedule 13. Enter these amounts on line 414 and line 126 of Schedule 1 respectively.

## Schedule 16, Patronage Dividend Deduction

Complete Schedule 16 if you are claiming a patronage dividend deduction. This deduction is for payments made to customers for allocations in proportion to patronage. An allocation in proportion to patronage entitles a customer to receive payment calculated at a rate relating to the quantity, quality, or value of either goods or products sold or services rendered.

Corporations have to pay amounts that qualify for this deduction either during the tax year, or in the 12 months that follow the tax year.

An agricultural cooperative corporation for a particular tax year can deduct patronage dividends issued in the form of tax deferred cooperative shares, but deductions cannot be more than 85% of its income for that year that is attributable to business done with its members.

Corporations other than credit unions and cooperative corporations cannot deduct patronage dividends paid to non-arm's length persons.

Parts 1, 2, and 3 of Schedule 16 give details on how to calculate the allowable patronage dividend deduction. Enter this deduction on line 416 of Schedule 1.

If you are claiming a patronage dividend deduction, you also have to complete Part 5 of Schedule 16 entitled "Calculation of income from an active business carried on in Canada (ABI)." Enter the amount from line 124 at line 400 of the return.

File a completed copy of this schedule with your return.

**Note:** Eligible members of agricultural cooperative corporations can defer including in income patronage dividends in the form of tax deferred cooperative shares issued before 2026 to the year of their disposal. However, a member may elect to have an amount included in income before the disposition of the shares. To make this election, the member must send a letter specifying the amount to be included in income with their return for the particular tax year.

- IT-362, Patronage Dividends

## Schedule 17, Credit Union Deductions

As a credit union, you may deduct bonus interest payments and payments for allocations in proportion to borrowing. If so, complete Schedule 17.

**Note:** Ontario and British Columbia provide a provincial tax reduction for credit unions. For details, see the provinces' specific sections on pages 110 and 126 respectively.

A credit union can deduct from its income for a tax year both the total of all bonus interest payments and the payments it made in the year to its members for allocations in proportion to borrowing. It can also deduct payments made in the 12 months after the end of the tax year. However, the credit union cannot deduct an amount if it could have deducted it in the previous tax year.

The allocation in proportion to borrowing for a tax year means an amount a credit union credits to a member that is entitled to, or will receive, this amount.

On Schedule 17, you have to calculate the payment made for allocations in proportion to borrowing at a rate that is related to one of the following:
- the amount of interest payable by the member on money the member borrowed from the credit union
- the amount of money the member borrowed from the credit union

You have to calculate the bonus interest payment at a rate that is related to one of the following:
- the interest payable by the credit union on money standing to the member's credit
- the amount of money standing to the member's credit

The amount the credit union credited to the member has to bear the same rate as the interest or money that the credit union similarly credited to all other members of the credit union of the same class.

Complete the appropriate parts of Schedule 17 to calculate this deduction. Add lines 305 and 315 of Schedule 17 and enter the result on line 315 of Schedule 1.

## Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim

The CRA publishes Guide T4088, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim – Guide to Form T661, which gives details on how to complete Form T661. For more information, go to canada.ca/taxes-sred.

File Form T661 if you carry on business in Canada and have incurred expenditures for scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) you carried on in Canada and for some salary or wage expenditures for SR&ED carried on outside Canada.

To avoid delays in processing, use the most recent version of Form T661.

A corporation has to file Form T661 to identify an expenditure and the SR&ED work to support its characterization as an SR&ED expenditure, as well as any claim preparer information.

If the corporation does not provide, in this way, the information about the expenditure, it cannot characterize the amount as an SR&ED expenditure.

If the corporation does not provide complete and accurate claim preparer information, a $1,000 penalty applies. However, the SR&ED claim will not be disallowed for this reason. When an SR&ED claim preparer participates in preparing a claim, the corporation and the SR&ED claim preparer are liable, together or separately, for the $1,000 penalty.

SR&ED expenditures, plus or minus adjustments, form a pool that you can deduct in the current year to calculate the net income for tax purposes or that you can carry forward and deduct in any future year.

If the SR&ED expenditures have been included in your income statement, enter the amount on line 118 of Schedule 1. Enter the SR&ED expenditures claimed in the year on line 411 of Schedule 1.

Form T661 summarizes the costs for all SR&ED projects. File it whether or not you claim an ITC. If you do not file Form T661 and Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, on or before the day that is 12 months after the filing due date of your income tax return for the tax year in which the SR&ED expenditures were made, you cannot claim SR&ED expenditures and earn an SR&ED ITC for that year. For more information, see "Lines 652 and 780 – Investment tax credits" on page 88.

A non-profit corporation for SR&ED (see "Box 2 – Exempt under paragraph 149(1)(j)", on page 29) has to file Form T661 on or before the filing due date for the tax year to avoid a late-filing penalty.

When a corporation is a member of a partnership that incurs SR&ED expenditures, the partnership, and not the members of the partnership, has to file Form T661 along with the T5013 FIN, Partnership Financial Return, and T5013 SUM, Information Slips Summary. Each member that receives an information slip T5013, Statement of Partnership Income, showing its share of the expenditures, does not have to file it with its return. They should keep it in case the CRA asks for it later.

## Losses

### Current-Year Losses

A corporation may not always have net income to report. Instead, it may have incurred a loss for the year. The different types of losses a corporation can incur are:
- non-capital loss
- farm loss
- restricted farm loss
- limited partnership loss
- capital loss

The application and continuity of the first four losses are calculated on Schedule 4, Corporation Loss Continuity and Application. Information on how to complete Schedule 4 follows this section.

Capital losses are determined on Schedule 6, Summary of Dispositions of Capital Property. For information on how to complete this schedule, see page 42.

### Applying Losses

A corporation can apply unused losses and deduct them from income it earned in the current tax year or in previous tax years.

**Note:** You can choose whether or not to deduct an available loss from income in a tax year. You can deduct losses in any order. However, for each type of loss, make sure to deduct the oldest available loss first.

You can view non-capital loss balances using the "View return balances" service through:
- My Business Account, at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account, if you are the business owner
- Represent a Client, at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if you are an authorized representative or employee

### Losses Carryback

You can use losses in any order, but consider the following:
- a current-year non-capital loss or farm loss can reduce any kind of income or taxable dividends subject to Part IV tax for the three previous years
- a net capital loss can reduce taxable capital gains included in your income for the three previous years
- a restricted farm loss can reduce farming income for the three previous years
- a listed personal property loss can reduce capital gains incurred on listed personal property for the three previous years

Except for net capital losses, you cannot use other year losses to create or increase a non-capital loss for the tax year.

Use Schedule 4 to request the carryback of any losses to prior years. If you do not attach your request to the return, you can send it separately to your tax centre.

### Calculating Losses When There Is an Acquisition of Control

Following an acquisition of control, special rules apply for calculating and deducting net capital losses, non-capital losses, and farm losses. You will find more information about these rules on Schedule 4 and at lines 063 and 065 on page 27. Also, see the following references for details.

## How to Complete Schedule 4, Corporation Loss Continuity and Application

### Part 1 – Non-Capital Losses

#### Determination of Current Year Non-Capital Loss

To determine the current-year non-capital loss, you have to complete Part 1 as follows:

1. Net income (loss) for income tax purposes – income from all sources minus losses from business and property, plus or minus the adjustments on Schedule 1;
2. deduct:
   - net capital losses deducted in the year – net capital losses from previous years used to reduce taxable capital gains included in income
   - taxable dividends deductible – taxable dividends received, deductible under section 112 or 113 or subsection 138(6) (for details, see Line 320 on page 72)
   - amount of Part VI.1 tax deductible – unused Part VI.1 tax deductible in the taxable income calculation
   - amount deductible as prospector's and grubstaker's shares – paragraph 110(1)(d.2) – the amount deductible is the value of any shares received from a corporation on disposition of a right or a mining property, except if the amount is exempt from tax in Canada by virtue of one of Canada's tax treaties, multiplied by 1/2
3. Subtotal – If the result is positive, enter "0"
4. deduct:
   - section 110.5 or subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) – addition for foreign tax deductions – any amounts added to the taxable income to use foreign tax deductions you could not otherwise deduct from Part I tax. For details, see Line 355 on page 74
5. add:
   - current-year farm loss – whichever is less: the net loss from farming or fishing included in the income, or the non-capital loss before deducting the farm loss

#### Current-Year Farm Loss

The current-year farm loss is whichever of the following amounts is less:
- the loss from farming or fishing that is more than the farming or fishing income for the year
- the amount of the current-year non-capital loss as calculated in Part 1 of Schedule 4 before you deduct the farm loss for the year

Enter the farm loss calculated on line 310 of Schedule 4. The farm loss can also include an amount allocated from a partnership.

If the result after the calculation shown under Part 1 is negative, enter this result (as positive) on line 110 of Schedule 4 as the current-year non-capital loss.

**Note:** You cannot use prior-year losses to create or increase a current-year non-capital loss, except with net capital losses of other years.

### Continuity of Non-Capital Losses and Request for a Carryback

Use this area to establish the continuity of non-capital losses and to carry back a current-year non-capital loss to prior years.

The current-year non-capital loss can reduce any kind of income or taxable dividends subject to Part IV tax for the 20 following tax years and for the 3 previous tax years. The loss expires after the carry-forward period.

When completing this part, line 105 is the amount of non-capital losses transferred from a predecessor corporation after amalgamation or a subsidiary after wind-up where not less than 90% of the issued shares in each class were, immediately before the wind-up, owned by the corporation. This amount is the unused non-capital losses available to be carried forward at the end of the tax year of the predecessor corporation or subsidiary ending immediately before the amalgamation or wind-up, minus any expired amount.

Line 150 is an amount received under subsection 111(10) as a fuel tax rebate that reduced non-capital loss for a previous year, and any other adjustments not previously mentioned. These adjustments would apply to corporations that have undergone an acquisition of control and whose losses that accrued before the acquisition of control are not deductible after the acquisition of control.

Line 140 is the amount of debt forgiveness under section 80 that reduces the non-capital losses balance. Losses have to be reduced in the order established by section 80.

The result of this part is the closing balance of non-capital losses you carry forward to future years (line 180). Complete Part 6 to establish the balance of non-capital losses by year of origin.

### Part 2 – Capital Losses

#### Continuity of Capital Losses and Request for a Carryback

The current-year capital loss is calculated on Schedule 6. See page 42 for more details. Complete this part to establish the continuity and the application of capital losses.

To establish the continuity, you have to enter the amount of capital losses and not the amount of net capital losses available. The inclusion rate will be used only when the loss is applied. You have to indicate the balance of any previous-year capital losses carried forward.

The net capital loss can reduce taxable capital gains included as income for the three previous tax years and indefinitely for future years.

When completing this part, line 205 is the amount of capital losses transferred from a predecessor corporation after
