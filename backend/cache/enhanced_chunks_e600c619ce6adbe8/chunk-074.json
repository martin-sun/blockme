Choosing the 40% rate exempts the share holder from the 10% tax under Part IV.1\n  - This rate applies to all future dividends on that class or series of shares\n\n#### Example\nIf a corporation paid $100,000 in dividends on short-term preferred shares and has an annual dividend allowance of $20,000:\n- Taxable amount: $100,000 -
