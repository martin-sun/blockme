This tax prevents the deferral of tax benefits within corporate groups.\n\n#### Taxable Dividends from Connected Corporations\n\nWhen a corporation receives taxable dividends from connected corporations, Part IV tax is calculated to prevent tax deferral within the corporate group.\n\n**Example:**\n- Parent Corp receives $50,000 in taxable dividends from Subsidiary Corp\n- The Part IV tax rate is 33.33% (refunded when dividends are paid to shareholders)\n- Part IV tax payable: $50,000 × 33.33% = $16,665\n\n#### Eligible Dividends from Non-Connected Corporations\n\nFor eligible dividends received from non-connected corporations, Part IV tax may also apply, though the calculation differs.\n\n**Implementation Note:**\n```javascript\n// Calculate Part IV tax on taxable dividends\nfunction calculatePartIVTax(dividendAmount, isConnectedCorporation) {\n  const taxRate = isConnectedCorporation ? 0.3333 : 0.3333; // Rates may vary\n  return dividendAmount * taxRate;\n}\n```\n\n### Reporting Part IV Tax\n\nEnter the calculated Part IV tax payable on line 712 of the T2 Corporation Income Tax Return.\n\n### Part IV.1 Tax Payable\n\nPart IV.1 tax applies to certain dividends received by corporations that are subject to the general tax reduction.\n\n#### Calculation Requirements\n\nTo determine Part IV.1 tax payable:\n\n1. Complete Schedule 43, \"Calculation of Parts IV.1 and VI.1 Taxes\"\n2. Apply the appropriate tax rate to eligible dividends\n3. Consider any applicable deductions or credits\n\n**Example:**\n- Corporation receives $100,000 in eligible dividends from portfolio investments\n- Part IV.1 tax rate: 10.67% (subject to change)\n- Part IV.1 tax payable: $100,000 × 10.67% = $10,670\n\n### Implementation Guidance for Developers\n\n#### Data Points Required:\n- Dividend amounts received\n- Connection status between corporations\n- Dividend eligibility status\n- Applicable tax rates (may vary by tax year)\n\n#### Validation Rules:\n- Ensure dividend amounts are positive values\n- Verify connection status for proper tax rate application\n- Check that Schedule 43 is completed when Part IV.1 tax applies\n\n#### References:\n- IT-269, Part IV Tax on Taxable Dividends Received by a Private Corporation or a Subject Corporation\n- Income Tax Act, Subsection 129(4)\n- T2 Corporation Income Tax Guide, Schedule 43 Instructions",
