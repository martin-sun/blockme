The value of a deduction depends on your marginal tax rate. For example, a $1,000 deduction for someone in a 30% tax bracket saves $300 in tax.\n*   **Tax Credit:** Reduces your *tax payable* directly, dollar-for-dollar. A $1,000 credit saves $1,000 in tax.\n\nFor developers, this means losses from a limited partnership must be applied against income calculations, not against the final tax balance.\n\n### The At-Risk Amount: The Primary Limitation\nA limited partner's ability to claim losses from a partnership is restricted by their **at-risk amount**. This represents the total amount the partner has financially invested in the partnership, including:\n\n*   Cash and property contributed.\n*   Amounts borrowed for the purpose of investing in the partnership for which the partner is personally liable.\n\nA partner cannot claim losses that exceed their at-risk amount at the end of the fiscal year. Any losses in excess of this amount are suspended and can typically be carried forward to future years when the at-risk amount increases.\n\n---\n\n### Claiming Current-Year Limited Partnership Losses\nLimited partners are allocated their share of the partnership's income or loss for the year. This information is reported on the **T5013 Statement of Partnership Income** slip.\n\n*   **Source of Data:** The net loss amount is reported in **Box 116 - Net business income (loss)** of the T5013 slip.\n*   **Claim Location on T1 General:** The amount from Box 116 is reported on **Line 13500 - Business income (loss)** of the T1 General Income Tax and Benefit Return.\n*   **Calculation Logic:** The claimable loss for the current year is the lesser of:\n    1.  The allocated loss from the T5013 slip.\n    2.  The partner's at-risk amount at the end of the year.\n\n**Practical Example:**\n*   A limited partner, Alex, is allocated a $15,000 business loss from their LP partnership for 2023 (reported on T5013).\n*   Alex's at-risk amount in the partnership at the end of 2023 is $10,000.\n*   **Actionable Result:** Alex can claim a maximum of **$10,000** as a business deduction on their 2023 tax return. The remaining $5,000 of the loss is suspended and carried forward to a future year.\n\n---\n\n### Applying Losses from Previous Tax Years\nIf a limited partner has a net loss for the current year after applying all current-year losses, they may be able to carry back **non-capital losses** to reduce taxable income in previous years.\n\n*   **Carryback Period:** Non-capital losses can be carried back **three (3) years**.\n*   **Mechanism:** To claim a carryback, the taxpayer must file a **T1A - Request for Loss Carryback** form with their tax return. The CRA will then reassess the prior year(s) and issue a refund for any tax overpaid.\n\n**Practical Example:**\n*   In 2023, a limited partner incurs a $20,000 net loss from their partnership and has no other income.\n*   In 2022, this partner had $50,000 of employment income and paid significant tax.\n*   **Actionable Result:** The partner can file a T1A with their 2023 return to carry back $20,000 of the loss to their 2022 tax year. This will reduce their 2022 taxable income from $50,000 to $30,000, resulting in a tax refund.\n\n---\n\n### Carrying Forward Losses to Future Years\nAny portion of a non-capital loss that is not used in the current year or carried back can be carried forward to future tax years.\n\n*   **Carryforward Period:** Non-capital losses can be carried forward for **twenty (20) years**.\n*   **Application:** These carried-forward losses are flexible and can be deducted against **any type of income** the taxpayer earns in future years (e.g., employment, business, or capital gains).\n*   **Tracking:** It is critical to track the original year of the loss, as the 20-year expiration period applies from that date.\n\n**Practical Example:**\n*   Continuing the previous example, the partner had a $20,000 loss in 2023.\n*   They carried back $15,000 to 2022.\n*   **Actionable Result:** The remaining **$5,000** is available as a non-capital loss carryforward. In 2024, if the partner earns $80,000 in employment income, they can use this $5,000 carryforward to reduce their 2024 taxable income to $75,000. The loss must be used before the end of the 2043 tax year (20 years after 2023).\n\n### Implementation Considerations for Tax Applications\nWhen building a tax module for limited partnership losses, developers should account for the following:\n\n1.  **Data Input:**\n    *   Capture all relevant fields from the **T5013 slip**, especially **Box 116**.\n    *   Provide a mechanism for users to input and track their **at-risk amount** for each partnership.\n    *   Maintain a database or record of **non-capital loss carryforwards**, including the original year of the loss and the remaining balance.\n\n2.  **Core Logic & Calculations:**\n    *   **Current Year Claim:** `ClaimableLoss = min(T5013_Box116_Loss, AtRiskAmount)`.\n    *   **Loss Suspension:** `SuspendedLoss = T5013_Box116_Loss - ClaimableLoss`. This amount is added to the carryforward balance.\n    *   **Carryback Logic:** If a net loss remains after all current-year deductions, prompt the user to consider a carryback. Automate the calculation of potential refunds for the prior 3 years.\n    *   **Carryforward Logic:** Allow users to apply their available non-capital loss carryforwards against any source of income in the current year. Enforce the 20-year expiration rule.\n\n3.  **Form Generation:**\n    *   Automatically populate **Line 13500** on the T1 General.\n    *   If a carryback is selected, generate the **T1A Request for Loss Carryback** form with the calculated amounts.",
