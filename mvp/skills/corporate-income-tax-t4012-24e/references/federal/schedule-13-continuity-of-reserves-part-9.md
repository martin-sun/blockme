### Line 632 – Federal Foreign Non-Business Income Tax Credit

Use Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to calculate this credit.

A federal foreign non-business income tax credit is available to Canadian residents to prevent double taxation of any non-business income earned in a foreign country that was taxed by that foreign country. The credit is also available to authorized foreign banks on their Canadian banking business from sources in a foreign country. This credit reduces Part I tax that the corporation would otherwise have to pay.

**Definition of Foreign Non-Business Income:**
- Includes dividends, interest, and capital gains
- Does not include dividends received from foreign affiliates
- Does not include income from operating a business in a foreign country

**Exclusions:**
Foreign non-business income tax does not include any foreign tax paid on income that is exempt from tax in Canada under an income tax treaty.

**Alternative Treatment:**
Under subsection 20(12), instead of claiming a foreign non-business income tax credit, a corporation can deduct from income all or any part of non-business income tax it paid to a foreign country.

**Unused Credits:**
If, after claiming the federal foreign non-business income tax credit, there is any foreign non-business income tax left over, you can claim it as a provincial or territorial foreign tax credit. See page 101 for details.

**Special Provision:**
Under section 110.5 and subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii), you can increase your taxable income so that you can use an otherwise non-deductible foreign non-business income tax credit. See "Line 355 – Section 110.5 additions or subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) additions" on page 74 for details.

**Filing Instructions:**
To claim this credit, complete Part 1 of Schedule 21. Calculate the federal foreign non-business income tax credit for each country separately. Use more than one schedule if more space is required. Add all the allowable foreign non-business income tax credits in column I on Schedule 21. Then, enter the total allowable credit or a lesser amount on line 632.

**References:**
- Subsection 126(1)
- S5–F2–C1, Foreign Tax Credit

### Line 636 – Federal Foreign Business Income Tax Credit

Use Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to calculate this credit.

To prevent double taxation, a corporation that pays foreign tax on income or profits it earned from operating a business in a foreign country can claim a federal foreign business income tax credit. This credit reduces the Part I tax that the corporation would otherwise have to pay.

**Key Difference from Non-Business Credit:**
Unlike foreign non-business income tax, you cannot deduct excess foreign business income tax paid as a provincial or territorial foreign tax credit. However, under section 110.5, you can increase taxable income so as to claim an otherwise non-deductible foreign business income tax credit. See Line 355 on page 74 for details.

**Filing Instructions:**
To claim this credit, complete Part 2 of Schedule 21. Calculate the foreign business income tax credit for each country separately. Use more than one schedule if more space is required. Add all allowable foreign business income tax credits in column J on Schedule 21. Then, enter the total allowable credits or a lesser amount on line 636.

**Important Notes:**
- Foreign business income tax does not include any foreign tax paid on income that is exempt from tax in Canada under an income tax treaty
- When calculating income for the year from sources in a foreign country, deduct the maximum amount of foreign exploration and development expense that is deductible on a country-by-country basis

**References:**
- Subsection 126(2)
- S5–F2–C1, Foreign Tax Credit

### Continuity of Unused Federal Foreign Business Income Tax Credits

Complete Part 3 of Schedule 21 if you have a foreign business income tax credit that:
- Expired in the current year
- Was transferred from an amalgamation or wind-up
- Was deducted in the current year, or
- Was carried back to a previous year

You must establish the continuity and the application of the foreign tax credits on business income for each country. Use more than one schedule if more space is required.

### Carryback or Carryforward of Unused Credits

You can carry back any unused foreign business income tax credit to the 3 previous tax years, and you can carry the credit forward for 10 tax years.

To claim a carryback to previous years, complete Part 4 of Schedule 21.

**Note:** You can use this credit only to reduce Part I tax on income originating from the same foreign country.

### Lines 638 and 639 – General Tax Reduction

Calculate this reduction on page 5.

**Filing Instructions:**
- If you were a CCPC throughout the tax year, enter the amount on line 638
- If you were a corporation other than a CCPC, an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation, a mutual fund corporation, or a corporation that has income that is not subject to the corporation tax rate of 38%, enter the amount on line 639

See "General tax reduction" on page 79 for details.

### Line 640 – Federal Logging Tax Credit

Corporations that have income from logging operations and have paid logging tax to the province of Quebec or British Columbia can claim this credit.

Complete Part 5 of Schedule 21, Federal and Provincial or Territorial Foreign Income Tax Credits and Federal Logging Tax Credit, to calculate this credit. On line 640, enter the credit you calculated on line 580 of Schedule 21 or a lesser amount.

**References:**
- Subsection 127(1)
- Regulation 700

### Line 641 – Eligible Canadian Bank Deduction Under Section 125.21

A Canadian parent bank can claim a deduction for certain amounts of non-resident withholding tax paid for interest arising from amounts that the parent bank owes to its non-resident affiliate.

The deduction must be net of any of this non-resident withholding tax amount that is available to the eligible bank affiliate, or any other person or partnership, as a credit, reduction, or deduction against an amount payable to the government of a country other than Canada, or a political subdivision of that country, under its laws and tax treaties, and any other agreements entered into by it.

- Subsection 95(2.43)
- Section 125.21

### Line 648 – Federal Qualifying Environmental Trust (QET) Tax Credit

A corporation that is the beneficiary under a qualifying environmental trust can claim a tax credit equal to Part XII.4 tax payable by the trust on that income.

**Definition of a QET:**
A QET is a trust that meets all of the following criteria:
- Whose trustees only include:
  - The federal or provincial Crown, or
  - A corporation resident in Canada and licensed or authorized under Canadian federal or provincial laws to carry on the business of providing services as trustee to the public in Canada
- That is maintained only to fund the reclamation of a site in Canada that is, or has been used primarily for, or for any combination of the following:
  - The operation of a mine
  - The extraction of clay, peat, sand, shale, or aggregates (including dimension stone and gravel)
  - The deposit of waste, or
  - If the trust was created after 2011, the operation of a pipeline
- That is, or may become within the specified time period, required to be maintained under:
  - A federal or provincial law
  - The terms of a contract entered into with the federal or provincial Crown, or
  - If the trust was established after 2011, an order of a tribunal constituted under federal or provincial law
- That is not an excluded trust, as defined under subsection 211.6(1) of the Income Tax Act

The rate of tax payable by a QET is currently 15%.

**Filing Instructions:**
On line 648, enter the credit claim up to the amount of Part I tax otherwise payable. On line 792 (page 9), enter any unused amount.

**Reference:**
- Section 127.41

### Line 652 – Investment Tax Credit

A corporation can claim an investment tax credit (ITC) to reduce Part I tax that it would otherwise have to pay, or in some cases this credit may be fully or partially refundable.

Use Schedule 31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations, to calculate the ITC.

**General Rule:**
A corporation earns ITCs by applying a specified percentage to the cost of acquiring certain property (investments) or on certain expenditures. However, you first have to reduce the capital cost of the property or the expenditure by any government or non-government assistance you received or will receive for that property or the expenditure. Any goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) input tax credit or rebate received for property acquired is considered government assistance.

On page 2 of Schedule 31, you will find a list of the percentages you have to apply to eligible investments and expenditures.

#### Available-for-Use Rule

A corporation is not considered to have acquired a property or made capital expenditures for earning an investment tax credit until the property becomes available for use.

For more information about the available-for-use rule, see "When is property available for use?" on page 46.

**References:**
- Subsections 13(26) to 13(32) and 127(11.2)

#### Investments and Expenditures That Qualify for an ITC

The following investments and expenditures earn an ITC:
A. The cost of acquiring qualified property
A.1 The cost of acquiring qualified resource property (only carry-forward amounts are allowed)
B. SR&ED qualified expenditure pool
C. Pre-production mining expenditures (only carry-forward amounts are allowed)
D. Apprenticeship expenditures
E. Eligible child care space expenditures (only carry-forward amounts are allowed)

**Note:** For clean economy ITCs, see Line 780 on page 135.

#### Definitions of Qualifying Investments and Expenditures

**A. Qualified property** is defined in subsection 127(9). It includes new prescribed buildings, prescribed machinery, and equipment or prescribed energy and conservation property acquired during the year to use in certain activities in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, the Gaspé Peninsula, and prescribed offshore regions (Atlantic region).

**A.1 Qualified resource property** is defined in subsection 127(9). You can no longer file a claim for this credit, since it expired December 31, 2015, and transitional measures expired December 31, 2016. Only unused credits that have not expired can be carried forward for up to 20 tax years following the tax year in which you made the investment.

**B. Qualified expenditure and SR&ED qualified expenditure pool** are defined in subsection 127(9). Scientific research and experimental development is defined in subsection 248(1).

**C. Pre-production mining expenditure** is defined in subsection 127(9). You can no longer file a claim for this credit, since it expired December 31, 2015, and so did transitional measures. Only unused credits that have not expired can be carried forward for up to 20 tax years that follow the tax year in which you made the investment.

**D. Apprenticeship expenditure** is defined in subsection 127(9).

**E. Eligible child care space expenditure** was defined in subsection 127(9) (the definition has been repealed). You can no longer file a claim for this credit, since it expired March 31, 2017, and transitional measures expired December 31, 2019. Only unused credits that have not expired can be carried forward for up to 20 tax years following the tax year in which you made the investment.

#### ITC for Qualified Property

You can earn ITCs on qualified property acquired mainly for use in designated activities in the Atlantic region.

**Designated activities include, among others:**
- Manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease

**Note:** Eligible machinery and equipment acquired after 2015 and before 2026 for use in Canada mainly for the manufacturing and processing of goods for sale or lease is included in class 53. These assets are qualified property for the ITC.

- Logging
- Farming or fishing
- Storing grain
- Harvesting peat

The ITC rate for qualified property is 10%.

**Special Rules for Lessors:**
In addition, the following rules apply to certain corporations that lease qualified properties such as prescribed machinery and equipment or prescribed energy generation and conservation property to lessees who use the property in any of the designated activities:

- For a corporation with a principal business of leasing property, lending money, or purchasing conditional sales contracts, accounts receivable, or other obligations, property acquired for the purposes of leasing it in the ordinary course of carrying on business in Canada is considered qualified property
- For a corporation with a principal business of manufacturing property that it sells or leases, a property is considered qualified property only if the corporation manufactures it and leases it in the ordinary course of its business in Canada
- For a corporation with a principal business of selling or servicing property, a property is considered qualified property only if it is a type of property that the corporation sells or services, and the property is leased in the ordinary course of carrying on business in Canada

#### Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Qualified Expenditure Pool

You have to file Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim, along with Schedule 31 when making a claim for an ITC on qualified expenditures for SR&ED. See page 65 for more information.

**Important Deadline:** You have to identify qualified SR&ED expenditures on Form T661 and Schedule 31 no later than 12 months after the filing due date for the year the expenditures were incurred (without reference to subsection 78(4)).

The SR&ED qualified expenditure pool includes qualified SR&ED expenditures, that is current expenditures the corporation incurred in the year, plus or minus adjustments, plus any qualified expenditures transferred to the corporation under an agreement as outlined in subsection 127(13), less any qualified expenditures transferred by the corporation under such an agreement.

For an agreement under subsection 127(13), see Form T1146, Agreement to Transfer Qualified Expenditures Incurred in Respect of SR&ED Contracts Between Persons Not Dealing at Arm's Length.

**References:**
- Subsections 37(11) and 127(9)

#### SR&ED Investment Tax Credit and Refund

You may earn a non-refundable ITC of 15% of the SR&ED qualified expenditure pool at the end of the tax year. Some CCPCs may earn the enhanced ITC at the rate of 35% on the SR&ED qualified expenditure pool, up to their expenditure limit.

The expenditure limit is $3 million and is subject to a phase-out based on the taxable capital employed in Canada of the CCPC and its associated corporations for the previous tax year. The limit begins to decrease when this capital reaches $10 million and becomes nil at $50 million and higher.

**Recent Legislative Changes (2024):**
The Government announced that, for tax years that begin on or after December 16, 2024:
- The expenditure limit would increase from $3 million to $4.5 million
- The phase-out thresholds would increase from $10 million and $50 million, to $15 million and $75 million, respectively. CCPCs would have the option to have their annual expenditure limit determined based on gross revenue instead of taxable capital
- The enhanced refundable SR&ED credit would be extended to Canadian public corporations. However, unlike CCPCs:
  - The $15 million and $75 million phase-out thresholds would be based on the corporation's gross revenue over the prior three years instead of its taxable capital for the preceding year
  - Qualifying expenditures in excess of an eligible Canadian public corporation's annual expenditure limit would not be eligible for a partially refundable SR&ED ITC
- For property acquired after December 15, 2024 (or lease costs first becoming payable after that date) the pre-2014 eligibility of capital expenditures would be reinstated to both the SR&ED income deduction and the SR&ED ITC
- Qualifying CCPCs eligible to earn a 35% SR&ED ITC would be entitled to partial refundability of the credit at a rate of 40% on their capital expenditures

**Associated Corporations:**
If the corporation is associated with one or more CCPCs, you have to allocate the expenditure limit among the associated CCPCs on Schedule 49, Agreement Among Associated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations to Allocate the Expenditure Limit. See page 34 for details about Schedule 49.

**CCPCs That Do Not Meet the Definition of Qualifying Corporation:**
CCPCs that do not meet the definition of qualifying corporation can earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure limit. This ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the year to offset Part I tax. The ITC earned on SR&ED expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is earned at the rate of 15% and it is not refundable.

**Definition of Qualifying Corporation:**
A qualifying corporation is a CCPC whose taxable income for the previous tax year before the application of the specified future tax consequences plus the taxable incomes of all associated corporations before the application of the specified future tax consequences (for tax years ending in the same calendar year as the corporation's previous tax year) is not more than the total of the qualifying income limits of the corporation and the associated corporations for those previous years.

The qualifying income limit is $500,000. It begins to decrease when the total taxable capital employed in Canada of the corporation and its associated corporations for the previous tax year reaches $10 million and becomes nil at $50 million.

**CCPCs That Meet the Definition of Qualifying Corporation:**
CCPCs that meet the definition of qualifying corporation can also earn ITCs at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified SR&ED expenditures up to their expenditure limit. This ITC can be refunded if it cannot be used in the year to offset Part I tax. For qualifying corporations, the ITC earned on SR&ED expenditures that exceed the expenditure limit is earned at the rate of 15%, of which 40% is also refundable.

**Special Association Rules:**
Corporations may be associated because the same group of persons controls them, but the members of this group do not act together and have no other connection to each other. CCPCs that are associated only because of the above definition of a group will not be considered associated for the following calculations:
- The refundable ITC on eligible SR&ED expenditures
- Calculating the expenditure limit
- Allocating the expenditure limit

For this exception to apply, one of the corporations must have at least one shareholder who is not common to both corporations.

**References:**
- Section 127.1
- Subsections 127(5) to 127(12) and 248(1)
- Regulations 2902 and 4600

#### Apprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit

A corporation can earn a non-refundable ITC equal to 10% of the eligible salaries and wages paid to eligible apprentices employed in the business in the tax year to a maximum credit of $2,000, per year, per apprentice.

**Definition of Eligible Apprentice:**
An eligible apprentice is one who is working in a prescribed trade in the first 24 months of their apprenticeship contract. This contract is registered with Canada or a province or territory under an apprenticeship program designed to certify or license individuals in the trade.

A prescribed trade will include the trades currently listed as Red Seal Trades. For more information about the trades, go to red-seal.ca. Also, the minister of Finance may in consultation with the minister of Employment and Social Development, prescribe other trades.

**Definition of Eligible Salaries and Wages:**
Eligible salaries and wages are those payable by the employer to an eligible apprentice for the apprentices' employment in Canada in the tax year and during the first 24 months of the apprenticeship. Eligible salaries or wages do not include qualified expenditures incurred by the corporation in a tax year, remuneration based on profits, bonuses, taxable benefits including stock options, and certain unpaid remuneration.

**Special Rules for Related Employers:**
Where two or more related employers employ an apprentice, special rules apply to ensure that the $2,000 limit is allocated to only one employer.

**Carryback and Carryforward:**
An unused credit can be carried back 3 years and carried forward 20 years.

**Filing Instructions:**
Complete parts 19 to 21 of Schedule 31 to calculate the credit.

#### Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for Child Care Spaces

**Note:** You can no longer earn this credit. It was eliminated for expenditures made after March 21, 2017, and so was the transitional measure for eligible expenditures incurred before 2020 under a written agreement entered into before March 22, 2017. You can only carry forward the non-refundable, unused, unexpired credit for 20 tax years.

To claim the carryforward, complete parts 22 and 23 of Schedule 31.

The credit will be added to the taxpayer's tax otherwise payable under Part I of the Act if, at any time within the 60 months of the day on which the taxpayer acquired the property:
- The new child care space is no longer available, or
- Property that was an eligible expenditure for this credit is sold or leased to another person or converted to another use

For more information on the recapture, see Line 602 on page 83.

#### Investment Tax Credit (ITC) Claim

You can deduct the full amount of ITC against federal Part I tax payable. If you are claiming an ITC for a depreciable property, reduce the capital cost of the property in the next tax year by the amount of this year's ITC. For more information, see Schedule 8, "Column 3 – Cost of acquisitions during the year", on page 49.

If you are claiming an SR&ED ITC to reduce tax payable or to receive a refund, you have to reduce the pool of deductible SR&ED expenditures in the next tax year. For more information see Line 435 in Guide T4088, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditures Claim – Guide to Form T661.

**Important Note:** A corporation cannot claim an ITC for an expense or expenditure incurred in the course of earning income if any of that income is exempt income or is exempt from tax under Part I.

**References:**
- Subsections 13(7.1), 37(1), and 127(5)

#### Carryback and Carryforward of ITCs

You can carry forward certain ITCs not previously deducted for 20 years, or carry them back 3 years, to reduce Part I tax. Remember that you can only carry back ITCs to a prior year if you cannot deduct them in the year you earn them.

Special rules restrict the carryforward and carryback of ITCs following an acquisition of control.

**References:**
- Paragraph 127(5)(a)
- Subsections 127(9.1), 127(9.2), and 127(36)

Complete Schedule 31 and file it with the return if the corporation:
- Acquired any qualified property or incurred any qualified expenditures for ITC purposes
- Is carrying forward unused ITCs from a previous year
- Is transferring unused ITCs from a predecessor corporation on amalgamation, or from a subsidiary corporation on wind-up

- Is requesting a refund of ITCs earned in the year

Complete Schedule 31 and enter the amount of the ITC for the current year on line 652 or 780.

**Important Deadline:** Eligibility for an ITC is limited to those expenses or expenditures identified in Schedule 31 filed within 12 months of the filing due date for the tax year in which the expenses were made or incurred [without reference to subsection 78(4)].

#### Investment Tax Credit Refund

For information about CCPCs claiming a refund of ITC for scientific research and experimental development, see "SR&ED investment tax credit and refund" on page 89.

**Note:** The clean economy ITCs are fully refundable. See the details in Line 780 on page 135.

You have to file Schedule 31 to claim the ITC refund. On line 780 of your return, enter the ITC refund claim calculated on Schedule 31.

### Part I Tax Payable

Part I tax payable for the year is:
- The basic Part I tax (amount A)
plus
- The personal services business income tax, the additional tax on banks and life insurers, the total labour requirements addition to tax, the amount of recapture of ITC, and the refundable tax on the CCPC's or substantive CCPC's investment income (amounts B, C, D, E, and J)
minus
