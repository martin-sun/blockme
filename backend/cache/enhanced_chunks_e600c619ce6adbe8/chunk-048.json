Start with net income for income tax purposes (line 300)\n2. Subtract all deductions entered on lines 311 to 352\n3. Add any applicable amounts from:\n   - Section 110.5 (certain stock option benefits)\n   - Subparagraph 115(1)(a)(vii) (non-resident trust income)\n4. Enter the final amount on line 360\n\n### Special Cases\n\n#### Loss Situations\nIf the calculation results in a negative amount, enter \"0\" on line 360.\n\n#### Loss Carrybacks\nTo carry back a current-year loss to a previous tax year, refer to \"How to complete Schedule 4\" on page 67 for detailed procedures.\n\n### Implementation Notes for Developers\n\nWhen building tax calculation functionality:\n\n1. Ensure proper calculation sequence:\n   ```javascript\n   taxableIncome = netIncome - totalDeductions + section1105Additions + subparagraph115Additions;\n   taxableIncome = Math.max(0, taxableIncome); // Handle losses\n   ```\n\n2. Validate input ranges for all line items (300, 311-352, 355)\n\n3. Implement error handling for:\n   - Missing required fields\n   - Invalid numeric values\n   - Calculation overflow scenarios\n\n4. Store intermediate values for audit trail purposes\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Standard Calculation\n- Net income (line 300): $65,000\n- Total deductions (lines 311-352): $8,500\n- Section 110.5 additions (line 355): $0\n- Taxable income (line 360): $65,000 - $8,500 + $0 = $56,500\n\n#### Example 2: With Section 110.5 Additions\n- Net income (line 300): $72,000\n- Total deductions (lines 311-352): $10,000\n- Section 110.5 additions (line 355): $2,000\n- Taxable income (line 360): $72,000 - $10,000 + $2,000 = $64,000\n\n#### Example 3: Loss Situation\n- Net income (line 300): $45,000\n- Total deductions (lines 311-352): $52,000\n- Section 110.5 additions (line 355): $0\n- Result: $45,000 - $52,000 + $0 = -$7,000 (loss)\n- Taxable income (line 360): $0\n\n### Additional Resources\nFor complete tax information, visit canada.ca/taxes",
