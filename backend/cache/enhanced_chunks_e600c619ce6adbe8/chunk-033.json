The partnership holds:\n- $300,000 in capital property (50% inclusion rate)\n- $200,000 in inventory/depreciable property (100% inclusion rate)\n\nThe corporation would report:\n- $150,000 capital gain (50% of $300,000) at 50% inclusion rate\n- $200,000 capital gain at 100% inclusion rate\n\n**Implementation Note**: For tax applications, track the composition of partnership assets to correctly apply inclusion rates.\n\n### Allowable Business Investment Losses (ABIL)\n\nABILs can be deducted from all sources of income in the year incurred. Any remaining balance becomes a non-capital loss with the following treatment:\n\n- **Non-capital loss carryback**: Up to 3 tax years\n- **Non-capital loss carryforward**: Up to 10 tax years\n- **After carryforward period expires**: Becomes a net capital loss with indefinite carryforward\n\n**Example**: A corporation realizes a $50,000 ABIL in 2023:\n- $30,000 deducted against 2023 income\n- $20,000 carried back to 2021 (reducing taxes paid)\n- If still unused after 2033, becomes net capital loss\n\n**Implementation Note**: Track ABILs separately from other losses to apply correct carryforward/carryback periods.\n\n## Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)\n\n### Basic CCA Rules\n\nCCA allows corporations to deduct part of the capital cost of depreciable property from income.
