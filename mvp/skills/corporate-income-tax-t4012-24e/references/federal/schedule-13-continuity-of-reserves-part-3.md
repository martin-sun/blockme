# Schedule 13, Continuity of Reserves (Part 3)

**Chapter 11**

## Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) - Detailed Instructions

### Immediate Expensing for Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations (CCPCs)

The property must meet one of the two following conditions:
- It has never been used and no person or partnership has claimed capital cost allowance (or a terminal loss) for the property
- It has not been transferred to the corporation on a tax deferred "rollover" basis and it was not previously owned or acquired by the corporation or a non-arm's length person or partnership

Schedule 8, Capital Cost Allowance (CCA), is the prescribed form for the immediate expensing claim.

The immediate expensing incentive has the following characteristics:
- It allows CCPCs to immediately write off the full cost of the DIEP up to $1.5 million per tax year
- It applies only to the DIEP
- It is available only for the year in which the property becomes available for use
- It is limited to $1.5 million per tax year, which will be shared among associated members of a group and prorated for tax years shorter than 365 days. If the capital cost of the DIEP is more than $1.5 million and is included in more than one CCA class, the CCPC can decide to which CCA class the immediate expensing incentive is attributed

**Note:** The immediate expensing deduction does not need to be prorated for a short tax year, as the immediate expensing deduction is already limited to the corporation's prorated immediate expensing limit for the tax year. This applies to tax years ending after April 18, 2021.

The carryforward of excess capacity for CCPCs with less than $1.5 million of eligible capital costs is not allowed. Existing enhanced CCA deductions will not reduce the amount available under this measure.

For details, see examples 6 and 7 under the heading "Schedule 8 examples" that follows.

### Completing Schedule 8

This section explains how to complete each column of Schedule 8. Use a separate line for each class of property.

**Reference:** S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance

#### Part 1 - Immediate Expensing Limit Allocation

Complete Part 1 if you are associated (under subsection 1104(3.6) of the Regulations) in the tax year with one or more eligible persons or partnerships (EPOPs) with which you have entered into an agreement. The purpose of the agreement is to assign a percentage to one or more of the EPOPs in the tax year to share the immediate expensing limit.

EPOP refers to a corporation that was a CCPC throughout the year, an individual (other than a trust) resident in Canada throughout the year or a Canadian partnership all of the members of which were individuals (other than trusts) or CCPCs throughout the period.

In the table, give the names of the associated EPOPs, their identification number and the percentage assigned under the agreement. Also provide the immediate expensing limit allocated to you. Such amount should be based on the percentage assigned to your corporation in column 3. If the sum of the percentages assigned under the agreement is more than 100%, the immediate expensing limit of the associated group is nil.

**Reference:** Regulations 1104(3.1) to (3.6)

#### Part 2 - CCA Calculation

Complete Part 2 to calculate your CCA deduction.

##### Column 1 – Class number

Identify each class of property with the assigned class number.

Generally, you have to group all depreciable property of the same class together. Then, calculate CCA on the undepreciated capital cost of all the property in that class. However, sometimes you have to maintain property of the same class in separate lines. For example, list on separate lines property that you would usually group in the same class but use to earn income from different sources. Also, list on a separate line each class 10.1 passenger vehicle and property you elected to identify in a separate class under Regulation 1101(5q).

**Note:** If a class number has not been provided in Schedule II of the Income Tax Regulations for a particular class of property, use the subsection provided in Regulation 1101 or 1100.

**Reference:** Regulations 1100 and 1101

##### Column 2 – Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year

Enter the amount of the undepreciated capital cost at the end of the previous tax year.

##### Column 3 – Cost of acquisitions during the year

For each class, enter the total cost of depreciable property you acquired in the tax year. Depreciable property is considered acquired when it becomes available for use. See page 46 for more information on the available-for-use rule.

Reduce the capital cost of a property by the following amounts:
- Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) input tax credit claimed or entitled to be claimed, or rebate received or entitled to be received in the year
- Federal investment tax credits (ITCs), other than scientific research and experimental development ITCs, used to reduce taxes payable or claimed as a refund in the previous tax year
- Reduction of capital cost after the application of section 80
- Provincial or territorial ITCs received or entitled to be received in the current year
- Government assistance received or entitled to be received in the year and described under paragraph 13(7.1)(f)
- Deemed decrease, under subsection 13(40), to the undepreciated capital cost of class 14.1 where you acquired property of that class through a non-arm's length transfer and the property had been eligible capital property of the transferor before January 1, 2017

Add to the capital cost of the property:
- Deemed increase, under subsection 13(39), to the undepreciated capital cost of class 14.1 where you disposed of property of that class after December 31, 2016, and that property had been eligible capital property before January 1, 2017
- Repayment of GST/HST input tax credit previously claimed
- Government assistance repaid in the year that previously reduced the capital cost and described under paragraph 13(7.1)(d)

The cost of acquisitions generally means the full cost of acquiring the property, including legal, accounting, engineering, and other fees. Land is not a depreciable property, and is therefore not eligible for CCA. List any acquisitions that are not subject to the 50% rule, separately. See Regulations 1100(2) and (2.2) for more information about these types of acquisitions. Do not enter section 85 transfers in this column.

**Note:** A corporation that receives an amount of non-government assistance to buy depreciable property has the option of either reducing the capital cost of the property by this amount, or including the assistance in its income.

**References:**
- Subsections 13(7.1) and 13(7.4)
- Paragraph 12(1)(x)
- Regulations 1100(2) and (2.2)

##### Column 4 – Cost of acquisitions from column 3 that are designated immediate expensing property (DIEP)

For each class, enter the total cost of all DIEPs that you acquired during the year. They are included in column 3 and shown separately in column 4.

DIEP generally means a property, other than a property included in classes 1 to 6, 14.1, 17, 47, 49, and 51, acquired by a CCPC after April 18, 2021, and that becomes available for use in the tax year (before 2024).

The property must meet one of the two following conditions:
- It has not been used and no person or partnership has deducted CCA or a terminal loss for the property
- It was not subject to a tax-deferred rollover and it was not previously owned or acquired by the eligible person or partnership or a non-arm's length person or partnership

**Reference:** Regulation 1104(3.1)

##### Column 5 – Adjustments and transfers

In some cases, you will have to adjust the UCC of a property. In column 5, enter the amounts that will either reduce or increase the UCC.

Reduce the UCC of a property by the following amounts:
- Any amount by which the UCC for the class is required (otherwise than because of a reduction in the taxpayer's capital cost of depreciable property) to be reduced at or before the time of the UCC calculation because of the debt forgiveness rules in subsection 80(5)
- Each amount of ITC allowed on a property for a tax year which has ended before the UCC calculation and after disposition of the property
- Each amount of assistance you received (or were entitled to receive) after the disposition of a property, if such assistance would have decreased the capital cost of the property by virtue of paragraph 13(7.1)(f)
- Each amount you received after February 23, 1998, and before the time of the UCC calculation for a refund of an amount as or on account of a proposed or existing countervailing or anti-dumping duty on a particular property added to the UCC of the class

Add to the UCC of the property:
- Any legally required repayment of assistance made after the disposition of a particular property, that would have otherwise increased the capital cost of the property under paragraph 13(7.1)(d)
- Any legally required repayment of an inducement, assistance or any other amount contemplated in paragraph 12(1)(x) received after the disposition of a particular property, that otherwise would have increased the capital cost of the property under paragraph 13(7.4)(b)
- Each amount payable after February 23, 1998, and paid before the time of the UCC calculation as or on account of a proposed or existing countervailing or anti-dumping duty on a particular property

Also include in column 5 depreciable property transferred on amalgamation or upon the wind-up of a subsidiary, and depreciable property transferred under section 85. Show the amounts that reduce the UCC in brackets. Do not include them as income.

**Reference:** Subsection 13(21)

##### Column 6 – Amount from column 5 that is assistance received or receivable during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition

Enter the total amount of assistance you received (or were entitled to receive) after the disposition of a property, if such assistance would have decreased the capital cost of the property if received before the disposition by virtue of paragraph 13(7.1)(f).

That amount is included in column 5 because it reduces the capital cost of a property. It is also reported separately in column 6.

**References:**
- Subsection 13(21)
- Paragraph 13(7.1)(f)

##### Column 7 – Amount from column 5 that is repaid during the year for a property, subsequent to its disposition

In column 7, include all amounts you have repaid during the year with respect to any legally required repayment, made after the disposition of a corresponding property, of:
- Assistance that would have otherwise increased the capital cost of the property under paragraph 13(7.1)(d)
- An inducement, assistance or any other amount contemplated in paragraph 12(1)(x) received, that otherwise would have increased the capital cost of the property under paragraph 13(7.4)(b)

These amounts are included in column 5 as they increase the capital cost of a property. They are also reported separately in column 7.

**References:**
- Subsection 13(21)
- Paragraphs 13(7.1)(d), 13(7.4)(b), and 12(1)(x)
- Regulation 1100(2.2)

##### Column 8 – Proceeds of dispositions

For each class, you usually enter the total proceeds of disposition received or are entitled to be received for property disposed of during the year. However, if you disposed of the property for more than its capital cost, enter the capital cost, not the actual proceeds of disposition.

A capital gain results when you dispose of a depreciable property for more than its capital cost. However, losses on depreciable property do not result in capital losses. They may result in terminal losses. For details about terminal losses, see column 22.

##### Column 9 – Proceeds of disposition of the DIEP

For any applicable DIEP reported in column 4, enter the total proceeds of disposition if you disposed of it during the year. They are included in column 8 and shown separately in column 9.

##### Column 10 – UCC

To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 10, do the following:
- Add the amounts in columns 2 and 3
- Either subtract or add the amount in column 5 (subtract if it is a negative amount, or add if it is a positive amount)
- Subtract the amount in column 8

You cannot claim CCA in the following situations:
- The amount in column 10 is positive, and no property is left in that class at the end of the tax year (a terminal loss)
- The amount in column 10 is negative (a recapture of CCA)

**Terminal loss**
A terminal loss results when you dispose of all the property in a particular class and there is an amount of undepreciated capital cost left in column 10. You have to deduct the terminal loss from income. If applicable, enter the positive amount from column 10 in column 22. For details, see example 1 under the heading "Schedule 8 examples" that follows.

**Recapture of CCA**
If the amount in column 10 is negative, you have a recapture of CCA. A recapture of CCA occurs when the proceeds of disposition in column 8 are more than the total of columns 2 and 3, plus or minus the amount in column 5 of that class.

You have to add the recapture to income. If applicable, enter the negative amount from column 10 in column 21 as a positive. For details, see example 2 under the heading "Schedule 8 examples" that follows.

The recapture and terminal loss rules do not apply to passenger vehicles in class 10.1. However, the recapture rules do apply to a passenger vehicle that was, at any time, a DIEP.

Once you have entered the recapture or terminal loss from column 10 in column 21 or 22, do not complete columns 23 and 24 for that line.

##### Column 11 – UCC of the DIEP

Enter the UCC amount that relates to the DIEP reported in column 4. That amount should not exceed the UCC amount reported in column 10.

##### Column 12 – Immediate expensing

The immediate expensing for CCPCs is the lesser of the following two amounts:
- The immediate expensing limit for the tax year
- The UCC of the DIEP for the tax year (amount from column 11)

The immediate expensing limit is equal to one of the following five amounts, whichever is applicable:
- $1.5 million, if the CCPC is not associated (under subsection 1104(3.6) of the Regulations) with any other EPOP in the tax year
- The immediate expensing limit allocated to the CCPC in Part 1 of Schedule 8, if the CCPC is associated with one or more EPOPs in the tax year and you entered into an agreement with them under subsection 1104(3.3) of the Regulations
- Nil, if the CCPC is associated with one or more EPOPs in the tax year and:
  - The total of the percentages assigned in the agreement is more than 100% or
  - The CCPC has not filed an agreement in prescribed form as required under subsection 1104(3.3) of the Regulations
- The amount determined under subsection 1104(3.5) of the Regulations for any second or subsequent tax years ending in a calendar year, if the CCPC has two or more tax years ending in the calendar year in which it is associated with another EPOP that has a tax year ending in that calendar year
- Any amount allocated by the minister under subsection 1104(3.4) of the Regulations

The immediate expensing limit has to be prorated if your tax year is less than 365 days.

**Reference:** Regulations 1100(0.1) and 1104(3.1) to (3.6)

##### Column 13 – Cost of acquisitions on remainder of class

Column 13 represents the cost of acquisitions that are not eligible for the immediate expensing incentive. This includes properties that are not DIEP or are DIEPs that have exceeded the immediate expensing deduction for the tax year.

To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 13, do the following:
- Add the amount in column 3
- Subtract the amount in column 12

##### Column 14 – Cost of acquisitions from column 13 that are accelerated investment incentive property (AIIP) or properties included in classes 54 to 56

For each class, enter the total cost of the AIIP or properties included in classes 54 to 56 that you acquired during the year. They are included in column 13 and shown separately in column 14.

AIIP generally means a property, other than property included in classes 54 to 56, acquired after November 20, 2018, and that becomes available for use before 2028.

For more details, see "Zero-emission vehicles –Classes 54 and 55", on page 46, "Zero-emission vehicles – Class 56", on page 47, and "Accelerated investment incentive property", on page 48.

**References:**
- Regulation 1104(4)
- Schedule II of the Regulations

##### Column 15 – Remaining UCC

Column 15 represents the remaining portion of UCC after applying the immediate expensing deduction. The remaining portion of UCC will be used to calculate the CCA deduction under subsection 1100(1) of the Regulations.

Subtract the amount in column 12 from the amount in column 10 and enter the difference.

**Reference:** Regulation 1100(0.2)

##### Column 16 – Proceeds of disposition available to reduce the UCC of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56

When you purchase an AIIP or a property included in classes 54 to 56 and a property other than an AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 during the year and a disposition occurs, the disposition first offsets the property other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56. Then it reduces the undepreciated capital cost of the AIIP or the property included in classes 54 to 56.

To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 16, do the following:
- Add the amount in column 8
- Add the amount in column 6
- Subtract the amount in column 13
- Add the amount in column 14
- Subtract the amount in column 7

**Reference:** Regulation 1100(2)

##### Column 17 – Net capital cost additions of AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year

Subtract the amount in column 16 from the amount in column 14 and enter the difference.

**Reference:** Regulation 1100(2)

##### Column 18 – UCC adjustment for AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 acquired during the year

You must adjust the remaining UCC (from column 15) to include an accelerated CCA component for accelerated investment incentive property and any property included in classes 54 to 56 that you acquired during the year.

Multiply the net capital cost of additions from column 17 by 0.5 unless a different factor is provided in the legislation.

**Reference:** Regulation 1100(2)

##### Column 19 – UCC adjustment for property acquired during the year other than AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 (previously known as the 50% rule)

Generally, property acquired during the tax year was only eligible for 50% of the normal maximum CCA for the year. You could claim full CCA for that property in the next tax year.

This 50% rule does not apply to certain property, including AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56.

To apply the 50% rule, the remaining UCC of the property (from column 15) has to be adjusted. This adjustment is equal to half of the net amount of additions to the class (the net cost of acquisitions minus the proceeds of dispositions). Enter this amount in column 19. For details, see example 3 under the heading "Schedule 8 examples" that follows.

When applying the 50% rule, do not reduce the net amount of additions by the ITC claimed in the previous tax year and included in column 5.

Certain properties acquired through non-arm's-length transfers or butterfly transfers (which occur in the course of certain reorganizations) are exempt from the 50% rule. The AIIP and property included in classes 54 to 56 are also exempt from the 50% rule. For special rules and exceptions, see Income Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance.

To calculate the amount you have to enter in column 19, do the following:
- Subtract the amount in column 14 from the amount in column 13
- Subtract the amount in column 6
- Add the amount in column 7
- Subtract the amount in column 8
- Multiply the result by 0.5

**References:** Regulations 1100(2) and 1100(2.2)

##### Column 20 – CCA rate

Enter the prescribed rate that applies, as provided for under Part XI of the Regulations. If a specific rate has not been provided for a particular class of property, enter N/A in this column.

Enter a rate only if you are using the declining balance method. In this method, the CCA is calculated by multiplying a constant rate by the diminishing balance every year.

**Note:** Some asset classes use the straight-line method to calculate the CCA. In this method, the CCA is calculated by dividing the original amount by the number of years that corresponds to the life expectancy of the property. Therefore, the deducted amount stays the same from one year to the other (except the first and last year, if the half-year rule applies for property acquired before November 21, 2018) and you do not have to enter a rate.

**Example:**
*Declining balance method* – The capital cost of an asset other than an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, or a property to which the immediate expensing was applied, is $780,000. The rate for the class is 10% with a half-year rule.

First year:  
10% × $780,000 = $78,000  
$78,000 ÷ 2 = $39,000 CCA (half-year rule) 

Second year:  
$780,000 – $39,000 = $741,000 (undepreciated capital cost)  
$741,000 × 10% = $74,100 CCA 

Third year: 
$741,000 – $74,100 = $666,900 (undepreciated capital cost)  
$666,900 × 10% = $66,690 CCA 

And so on for the following years.

*Straight-line method* – The capital cost of an asset other than an AIIP, a property included in classes 54 to 56, or a property to which the immediate expensing was applied, is $780,000. The asset's life expectancy is 10 years and the half-year rule does not apply. Therefore, the capital cost allowance will be $78,000 per year ($780,000 ÷ 10).

Class 13 (property that is a leasehold interest) uses the straight-line method (with the half-year rule for property acquired before November 21, 2018). An accelerated investment incentive applies to class 13 for property acquired after November 20, 2018. See Accelerated investment incentive property on page 48.

If a disposition of all leasehold interests in class 13 occurs during the amortization period, the terminal loss is claimed in the year it occurs if the lessee does not acquire a depreciable property that is a leasehold interest before the end of the year.

For more information on the half-year rule, see Income Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance.

##### Column 21 – Recapture of CCA

Enter the amount of recapture from column 10, if applicable. Be sure you include the recapture as income. Enter the total of amounts from column 21 on line 107 of Schedule 1.

The recapture rules do not apply to passenger vehicles in class 10.1. However, recapture does apply to a passenger vehicle that was, at any time, a DIEP.

**References:** Subsections 13(1) and 13(2)

##### Column 22 – Terminal loss

Enter the terminal loss from column 10, if applicable. Deduct the terminal loss from income. Enter the total of amounts from column 22 on line 404 of Schedule 1.

The terminal loss rules do not apply to:
- Passenger vehicles in class 10.1
- Property in class 14.1, unless you have stopped carrying on the business to which it relates
- Limited-period franchises, concessions, or licences in class 14 if, at the time of acquisition, the property was a former property of the transferor or any similar property attributable to the same fixed place of business, and you had jointly elected with the transferor to have the replacement property rules apply, unless certain conditions are met

**Reference:** Subsection 20(16.1)

##### Column 23 – CCA

To claim the maximum CCA for each class, for the declining balance method, do the following calculation:
- Add the amount in column 15 and the amount in column 18
- Subtract the amount in column 19
- Multiply the result by the rate in column 20
- Add the amount in column 12

Enter the result in column 23. You do not have to claim the maximum allowable CCA. You can claim any amount up to the maximum.

If the tax year is less than 365 days, prorate the CCA claim for all property except for those classes of property that Regulation 1100(3) excludes. The exceptions in Regulation 1100(3) include:
- Class 14 assets
- Class 15 assets
- Timber limits and cutting rights
- Industrial mineral mines
- Certified productions
- Canadian film or video productions
- Certain mining equipment in classes 28 and 41

To determine the maximum CCA claim, multiply the maximum CCA for a complete year by the number of days in the tax year divided by 365.

**References:**
- Regulation 1100(3)
- S4-F15-C1, Manufacturing and Processing

The total of all amounts in column 23 is the CCA claim for the tax year. Deduct this amount on line 403 of Schedule 1.

**Notes:** If you want to change the amount of CCA claimed in a tax year, send a written request within 90 days of the date on the notice of assessment or notice of reassessment. Only under certain circumstances can the CRA make adjustments after the 90-day period has expired.

For more information, see Information Circular IC84-1, Revision of Capital Cost Allowance Claims and Other Permissive Deductions.

##### Column 24 – UCC at the end of the year

Subtract the amount in column 23 from the amount in column 10 and enter the difference. When there is a recapture of CCA or a terminal loss for a particular class in the year, the undepreciated capital cost at the end of the year is always nil.

## Schedule 8 Examples

### Example 1: Terminal loss

A manufacturing business decided to sell its warehouse because it is better to lease instead. The business received $60,000 for the warehouse. At the end of the 2024 tax year, the business had no more assets in class 3.

The business's Schedule 8 for its 2024 tax year looks like this:

| Column | Description | Amount |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Class number | 3 |
| 2 | Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the beginning of the year | $65,000 |
| 8 | Proceeds of dispositions | $60,000 |
| 10 | UCC (column 2 plus column 3 plus or minus column 5 minus column 8) | $5,000 |
| 20 | CCA rate % | n/a |
| 22 | Terminal loss | $5,000 |
| 24 | UCC at the end of the year (column 10 minus column 23) | $0 |

The amount in column 22 is a terminal loss. The manufacturing business deducts the $5,000 terminal loss from its income (line 404 of Schedule 1).
