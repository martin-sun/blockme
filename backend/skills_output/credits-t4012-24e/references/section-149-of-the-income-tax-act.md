## Corporate Tax Credits and Filing Requirements

### Electronic Filing Requirements

#### Mandatory Electronic Filing
Most corporations are required to file their T2 Corporation Income Tax Return electronically. This requirement applies to all corporations except for those specifically exempt by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

**Key Points:**
- Corporations that fail to file electronically when required are subject to penalties
- The $1 million threshold exemption was eliminated for tax years starting after 2023
- Reference: Subsection 150.1(2.1) and Regulation 205.1(2)

#### Corporation Internet Filing Benefits
When filing electronically using CRA-approved certified software, corporations receive:
- Immediate confirmation of receipt
- Faster processing and refunds
- Reduced mailing costs
- Environmental benefits through paper reduction

#### T2 Attach-a-doc Service
This service allows corporations to attach supporting documentation (such as certificates) when filing their T2 return or within 24 hours of filing.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Not mandatory for all certified software products
- Availability varies by software provider
- Contact your software provider for specific service availability

**Alternative Documentation Submission:**
If unable to use T2 Attach-a-doc:
1. Send documents to your tax center (see "Where to file your paper return")
2. Clearly identify corporation name, business number, and tax year-end on all documents

#### Special Elections
For elections without prescribed forms:
- Include with notes to financial statements on the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI)
- Transmit electronically with return unless otherwise specified on T2-related forms

### Filing Without Web Access Code
Corporations can file online without a web access code through:
- My Business Account (for business owners): canada.ca/my-cra-business-account
- Represent a Client (for authorized representatives): canada.ca/taxes-representatives

### North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes

#### NAICS Code Requirements
All certified T2 tax preparation software uses self-identified NAICS codes to classify business activities.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Hierarchical numerical codes (up to 6 digits)
- Used for economic analysis and fiscal policy by all levels of Canadian government
- Required for active corporations filing electronically or on paper with 2D barcodes

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Corporations must select their main revenue-generating business activity
- First year's selection carries forward to subsequent years
- Accurate initial selection prevents future validation errors

**Exception:**
Corporations using the return available on Canada.ca are not required to enter a NAICS code.
