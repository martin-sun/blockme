The fundamental sequence involves calculating tax on the taxable income and then applying tax credits to reduce the final liability.\n\nThe core calculation logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Base Tax:** Apply the appropriate federal and provincial/territorial tax rates to the corporation's taxable income.\n2.  **Apply Non-Refundable Tax Credits:** Subtract the total value of eligible non-refundable credits from the base tax. This can reduce the tax payable to zero, but not below.\n3.  **Apply Refundable Tax Credits:** Certain credits are refundable. If these credits exceed the tax payable after step 2, the corporation can claim the excess as a refund.\n\n**Simplified Formula:**\n`Tax on Taxable Income - Non-Refundable Tax Credits = Part I Tax Payable`\n`Part I Tax Payable - Refundable Tax Credits = Final Balance Owing or Refund`\n\n---\n\n### Understanding Non-Refundable Tax Credits\n\nNon-refundable tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax a corporation owes. They are applied after the initial tax calculation on taxable income. If the total of these credits is more than the tax payable, the excess is generally lost (though some may be carried forward or back to other years).\n\n#### Common Non-Refundable Credits\n\n*   **Federal Tax Abatement:** A general reduction of federal tax intended to allow provinces to tax corporate income.\n*   **Small Business Deduction (SBD):** While technically a reduction in the tax rate, it is a key component of the Part I calculation on T2 Schedule 5, reducing the tax rate on active business income up to a certain limit.\n*   **Investment Tax Credits (ITCs):** For eligible expenditures on scientific research, experimental development (SR&ED), or specific equipment (T2 Schedule 11).\n*   **Donations and Gifts:** A credit for charitable donations made to registered charities (T2 Schedule 9).\n\n#### Practical Example: Non-Refundable Credit\n\n**Scenario:** \"Tech Innovators Inc.\" has a taxable income of $500,000. They are eligible for a $15,000 Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for acquiring eligible equipment.\n\n1.  **Calculate Base Federal Tax (simplified):**\n    *   Taxable Income: $500,000\n    *   Federal Rate (general): 15%\n    *   Base Federal Tax: $500,000 * 15% = $75,000\n\n2.  **Apply Non-Refundable Credit:**\n    *   Base Federal Tax: $75,000\n    *   Less: ITC: ($15,000)\n    *   **Part I Federal Tax Payable: $60,000**\n\nThe ITC directly reduced the tax liability from $75,000 to $60,000.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding Refundable Tax Credits\n\nRefundable tax credits are more valuable as they can create a tax refund. If the credit amount exceeds the corporation's tax payable, the difference is refunded to the corporation. These are often designed to encourage specific activities by improving cash flow.\n\n#### Common Refundable Credits\n\n*   **Refundable Portion of SR&ED ITCs:** For Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs), a portion of the SR&ED ITC is refundable, even if the corporation has no tax liability.\n*   **Dividend Refund:** A refundable tax paid on investment income that can be refunded when the corporation pays taxable dividends to its shareholders (calculated on T2 Schedule 9).\n*   **Film or Video Production Services Tax Credit:** A refundable credit for eligible labour expenditures.\n\n#### Practical Example: Refundable Credit\n\n**Scenario:** \"Green Energy Corp.\" is a CCPC with $50,000 of taxable income, resulting in $7,500 of federal tax. They have a $20,000 refundable SR&ED ITC.\n\n1.  **Calculate Base Federal Tax:**\n    *   Taxable Income: $50,000\n    *   Federal Rate (small business): 9% (for this example)\n    *   Base Federal Tax: $50,000 * 9% = $4,500\n\n2.  **Apply Refundable Credit:**\n    *   Part I Federal Tax Payable: $4,500\n    *   Less: Refundable SR&ED ITC: ($20,000)\n    *   **Tax Refund Owed to Corporation: $15,500**\n\nThe credit not only eliminated the tax liability but also generated a $15,500 cash refund.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Considerations for Tax Applications\n\nWhen building logic for T2 tax calculations, developers must accurately model the application of credits.\n\n#### Required Data Points\n*   `taxable_income`: The final income figure from T2 Schedule 1.\n*   `corporation_type`: e.g., CCPC, to determine eligibility for specific credits.\n*   `provincial_territory`: Needed for the tax abatement and provincial credit calculations.\n*   `credit_details`: An object or array containing all claimed credits, each with:\n    *   `credit_type`: (e.g., 'ITC_SR ED', 'DONATIONS', 'DIVIDEND_REFUND').\n    *   `amount`: The calculated value of the credit.\n    *   `is_refundable`: A boolean flag.\n    *   `source_schedule`: The T2 schedule where the credit is calculated (e.g., 'SCH11', 'SCH32').\n\n#### Calculation Logic Steps\n1.  **Fetch Base Tax:** Calculate the initial federal and provincial tax based on `taxable_income` and applicable rates (often involving T2 Schedule 5).\n2.  **Aggregate Non-Refundable Credits:** Sum all credits where `is_refundable` is `false`.\n3.  **Calculate Interim Tax Payable:** `base_tax - total_non_refundable_credits`. The result cannot be less than zero.\n4.  **Aggregate Refundable Credits:** Sum all credits where `is_refundable` is `true`.\n5.  **Determine Final Balance:** `interim_tax_payable - total_refundable_credits`.\n    *   If the result is positive, it's the **Balance Owing**.\n    *   If the result is negative, the absolute value is the **Refund**.\n\n#### Key Schedules for Data Integration\n*   **T2 Schedule 5:** Tax Calculation. This is the central schedule where the final tax payable is calculated and credits are applied.\n*   **T2 Schedule 11:** Investment Tax Credits. Used to calculate most ITCs.\n*   **T2 Schedule 32:** SR&ED Expenditures and Deductions. Details for the SR&ED program.\n*   **T2 Schedule 9:** Dividends. Used to calculate the dividend refund.",
