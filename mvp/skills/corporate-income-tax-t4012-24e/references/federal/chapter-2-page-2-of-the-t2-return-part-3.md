### Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP)

The Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) allows corporations to voluntarily correct errors or omissions in their tax filings. Corporations that make a valid disclosure will not be subject to gross negligence penalties or criminal prosecution related to the disclosed information. However, other penalties and interest will still apply as required by law.

**General Program Benefits:**
- No penalties charged for disclosed errors
- No criminal prosecution for disclosed information
- Partial interest relief for years preceding the three most recent years of returns required to be filed

For complete details on the VDP, refer to the latest version of Information Circular IC00-1, Voluntary Disclosures Program, or visit canada.ca/taxes-voluntary-disclosures.

**Pre-discussion Process:**
You may discuss your situation on a no-name or hypothetical basis by contacting General Enquiries at 1-800-959-5525. For complex technical issues, you will be referred to a specialized CRA official. Note that pre-disclosure discussions do not constitute acceptance into the VDP, and the no-name disclosure process has ended.

### Information Reporting of Tax Avoidance Transactions

Taxpayers, advisors, and promoters involved in certain tax avoidance transactions must comply with specific reporting requirements. Ontario and British Columbia corporations must meet the same requirements under provincial legislation.

**Recent Changes (Effective After June 21, 2023):**
The definition of "avoidance transaction" has been amended to include transactions where it can reasonably be concluded that one of the main purposes is to obtain a tax benefit.

The mandatory disclosure rules now include:
- Modified reportable transaction rules
- New notifiable transaction requirements
- New reportable uncertain tax treatment requirements
- Related penalties and extended assessment periods for non-compliance

### Reportable Transactions

**Effective Date:** Transactions entered into after June 21, 2023

A transaction is reportable if it meets both conditions:
1. It is an avoidance transaction as defined in subsection 237.3(1) of the Income Tax Act (previously 245(3))
2. It has at least one of the following three generic hallmarks (reduced from two):
   - The advisor or promoter (including non-arm's length parties) has entitlement to certain types of fees
   - The advisor or promoter (including non-arm's length parties) has confidential protection regarding tax treatment
   - The taxpayer, advisor, or promoter (including non-arm's length parties) has contractual protection for the transaction (excluding certain normal commercial transactions)

**Exclusions:**
A reportable transaction does not include transactions that are part of a series involving:
- Acquisition of a tax shelter with a filed information return under subsection 237.1(7)
- Issuance of flow-through shares with a filed return under subsection 66(12.68)

For examples of activities that do not meet hallmark requirements, visit canada.ca/mandatory-disclosure-rules#toc6.

### Notifiable Transactions and Reportable Uncertain Tax Treatments

**Notifiable Transactions:**
The Minister of National Revenue can designate transactions as notifiable (with Finance Minister agreement). These have similar reporting requirements to reportable transactions using a prescribed form. A notifiable transaction is one that is the same as, or substantially similar to, a designated transaction.

For the current list of notifiable transactions, visit canada.ca/notifiable-transactions. Subscribe to CRA's electronic mailing list at canada.ca/cra-email-lists to receive notifications of new designations.

**Reportable Uncertain Tax Treatments:**
Specified corporations must report uncertain tax treatments with their T2 return if:
- They have at least $50 million in assets at the end of the financial year coinciding with the tax year
- The tax treatment has uncertainty regarding acceptance under tax law

This applies to tax years beginning after 2022, with penalties not applying to years beginning before June 22, 2023.
