## Identification

Accurately complete page 1 of your return, so the CRA can properly identify the corporation and process the return more quickly. You cannot use the Corporation Internet Filing service to change the corporation's head office address or mailing address.

You can change the mailing, physical, and books and records address of the corporation by:
- using the "Manage addresses" service through:
  - My Business Account at canada.ca/my-cra-business-account, if you are the business owner
  - Represent a Client at canada.ca/taxes-representatives, if you are an authorized representative or employee
- calling 1-800-959-5525

### Signing up for email notifications when filing your T2 return

Corporations that use tax preparation software can register for email notifications by sending the CRA their email address and agreeing to electronic delivery of correspondence when they file their return. Once the CRA has processed your return, it will send you a registration email notification to the email address you gave, confirming your registration.

If you register for email notifications for your T2 account, the CRA will send you an email when notices, letters, or statements are available for viewing in My Business Account (separate registration is required) and when other important changes are made on your account.

To register for My Business Account, go to canada.ca/my-cra-business-account.

If you signup for email notifications, the CRA will not send these documents to you through Canada Post.

The default method of correspondence for businesses that use My Business Account became electronic, effective on June 22, 2023. However, with a 30-day notice, businesses may still choose to also receive paper correspondence.

If you don't want to receive email notifications anymore, log into My Business Account and select "Notification preferences" to remove your email address.

For more information on how to register for email notifications, the types of notifications you can receive, and how to know if an email notification is from the CRA, go to canada.ca/cra-business-email-notifications.

## Line 001 – Business number (BN)

The BN is a 15-character number composed of three parts. The first nine characters identify your business. The "RC" identifies the corporation income tax program. The last four characters identify the particular program account.

On line 001, enter your BN for income tax purposes. Enter "0001" as the program account identifier unless the CRA has advised you to use a different one. You will find the corporation's BN on previous notices of assessment, account statements, or remittance forms. For more information, go to canada.ca/business-number.

**Note:** If you are a non-resident corporation that needs a BN, you have to give the CRA a copy of your certificate of incorporation or amalgamation before it can assign a BN to you. You also have to give the CRA documentation for any amendments that may have taken place.

## Lines 040 and 043 – Type of corporation at the end of the tax year

### Line 040

Tick the box that describes the corporation type at the end of the tax year. The corporation type determines whether or not the corporation is entitled to certain rates and deductions. See the following for details.

**Reference:** IT-391, Status of Corporations

#### Box 1 – Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC)

The corporation is a CCPC if it meets all of the following requirements at the end of the tax year:
- it is a private corporation
- it is a corporation that was resident in Canada and was either incorporated in Canada or resident in Canada from June 18, 1971, to the end of the tax year
- it is not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more non-resident persons
- it is not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more public corporations (other than a prescribed venture capital corporation, as defined in Regulation 6700)
- it is not controlled by a Canadian resident corporation that lists its shares on a designated stock exchange outside of Canada
- it is not controlled directly or indirectly by any combination of persons described in the three previous conditions
- if all of its shares that are owned by a non-resident person, by a public corporation (other than a prescribed venture capital corporation), or by a corporation with a class of shares listed on a designated stock exchange were owned by one person, that person would not own sufficient shares to control the corporation
- no class of its shares of capital stock is listed on a designated stock exchange

**Note:** A CCPC that has elected under subsection 89(11) not to be a CCPC for certain purposes should tick box 1 when filling line 040.

**References:** Subsections 89(1), 89(11), 89(12), and 125(7); IT-458, Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation

#### Box 2 – Other private corporation

The corporation is an other private corporation if it meets all of the following requirements at the end of the tax year:
- it is resident in Canada
- it is not a public corporation
- it is not controlled by one or more public corporations (other than a prescribed venture capital corporation, as defined in Regulation 6700)
- it is not controlled by one or more prescribed federal Crown corporations (as defined in Regulation 7100)
- it is not controlled by any combination of corporations described in the two previous conditions

For information about substantive CCPCs, see line 290 on page 40.

**References:** Subsection 89(1); Regulations 6700 and 7100

#### Box 3 – Public corporation

The corporation is a public corporation if it is resident in Canada and meets either of the following requirements at the end of the tax year:
- it has a class of shares listed on a designated Canadian stock exchange
- it has elected, or the minister of National Revenue has designated it, to be a public corporation and the corporation has complied with prescribed conditions under Regulation 4800(1) on the number of its shareholders, the dispersing of the ownership of its shares, the public trading of its shares, and the size of the corporation

If a public corporation has complied with certain prescribed conditions under Regulation 4800(2), it can elect, or the minister of National Revenue can designate it, not to be a public corporation.

**References:** Subsections 89(1) and 248(1); Regulations 4800(1) and 4800(2)

#### Box 4 – Corporation controlled by a public corporation

The corporation is a corporation controlled by a public corporation if it is a Canadian subsidiary of a public corporation. This type of corporation does not qualify as a public corporation for determining the type of corporation.

#### Box 5 – Other corporation

The corporation is an other corporation if it does not fall within the other categories. Examples of other corporations include general insurers and Crown corporations.

**Note:** Credit unions or cooperative corporations should tick box 1 at line 040 if they meet the definition of a Canadian-controlled private corporation under subsection 125(7) (without reference to subsections 137(7) or 136(1) respectively).

### Line 043 – If the type of corporation changed during the tax year, provide the effective date of the change

Indicate the effective date of the change. Do not include other types of changes in this section, such as the change from active to inactive status.

A change of corporation type may bring significant tax consequences. For example, certain calculations on the return depend on whether the corporation was a private corporation or a CCPC throughout the tax year, at any time in the tax year, or at the end of the tax year.

**Note:** If the corporation changed from, or to, a CCPC, see Line 066. Do not complete line 043 if you answer yes at line 066 and you are filing a tax return with a deemed tax year-end because of subsection 249(3.1).

## Lines 060, 061, 063, 065 – To which tax year does this return apply?

### Specify hours and minutes

When using Corporation Internet Filing, you can now specify hours and minutes in the tax year-end (TYE) at line 061 when the TYE has changed for any of the following reasons (you answered yes at the line number in brackets):
- acquisition of control under subsection 249(4) when electing not to apply subsection 256(9) (line 063)
- change to the TYE when changing from a Canadian-controlled private corporation to another type of corporation under subsection 249(3.1) (line 066)
- first year after amalgamation (line 071)
- final year before amalgamation (line 076)

**Note:** You can also specify hours and minutes in the tax year start (TYS) at line 060 when the TYE in the prior year had specified hours and minutes (you answered yes at any of the above line numbers in brackets in the current TYE or answered yes at line 063 or 066 in the prior TYE).

You can also specify hours and minutes in the date entered at line 065, which is the date of the acquisition of control resulting in the application of subsection 249(4).

Time is to be reported by the 24-hour clock. You do not need to specify the hours and minutes if the time of the TYS is 00:00 or the TYE is 23:59 (11:59 pm). For CRA purposes, the beginning of a day is 00:00 and the end of a day is 23:59.

Hours and minutes should only be entered when the event results in the corporation (or successor) starting a tax year on the same day the previous tax year ends. In the following example, see how to report hours and minutes for a multiple amalgamation on the same day.

**Example:** Two predecessor corporations amalgamate (yes at line 076) on January 15, 2024, at 09:44. Both have a TYS of January 1, 2024.

Both predecessors will report:
- line 060 (TYS) as 2024-01-01 00:00
- line 061 (TYE) as 2024-01-15 09:43

The new corporation (yes at line 071) is also a final to amalgamation (yes at line 076) on January 15, 2024, with its final to amalgamation taking place at 17:27.

The new/predecessor corporation will report:
- line 060 (TYS) as 2024-01-15 09:44
- line 061 (TYE) as 2024-01-15 17:26

### Lines 060 and 061 – Tax year start and tax year-end

The corporation's tax year is its fiscal period. A fiscal period cannot be longer than 53 weeks (371 days).

In the spaces provided, enter the first and last days of the tax year. If the particular time of day applies, enter the hours and minutes to specify the time. The first day of this tax year has to be the day after the last day of the previous tax year. You have to file a return for every calendar year.

A new corporation may choose any tax year-end as long as its first tax year does not exceed 53 weeks from the date it was either incorporated or formed as a result of an amalgamation.

Make sure the financial statements or the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) you attach to the return match the tax year of the return.

**Note:** A professional corporation that is a member of a partnership and that carries on business in Canada has to have a December 31 year-end.

Generally, unless you have received approval to change the fiscal period, the corporation's fiscal period is the same from year to year. To change a fiscal period, write a letter to your tax services office asking for approval and include details to explain the reasons for the change as well as its effective date. If you do not include these details, the processing of your request may be delayed.

In some situations, you do not need approval to change the fiscal period. These situations include any of the following:
- the corporation has wound-up and you are filing its final return with an abbreviated fiscal period
- the corporation has to end its tax year at a certain time because it is emigrating to another country, becoming exempt from tax, or ceasing to be exempt from tax
- a person or group of persons acquired control of the corporation under subsection 249(4)
- the corporation becomes or ceases to be a Canadian-controlled private corporation

**Note:** A corporation that becomes bankrupt must get CRA's approval to change its fiscal period.

**References:** IT-364, Commencement of Business Operations; IT-454, Business Transactions Prior to Incorporation

### Lines 063 and 065 – Has there been an acquisition of control resulting in the application of subsection 249(4) since the tax year start on line 060?

If you answer yes, enter on line 065 the date the control was acquired.

There is an acquisition of control when, during the tax year, a person or group of persons acquired control of the corporation.

When control is acquired, subsection 249(4) provides that the tax year of the corporation ends immediately before that control is acquired. You do not need approval for the changed tax year.

File a return for the tax year that ends immediately before control is acquired. The next tax year starts at the time control is acquired, and the corporation can choose any tax year-end within the next 53 weeks.

If control is acquired up to seven days after the end of an established tax year, generally a corporation can choose to extend the tax year up to the time control is acquired. In this case, attach a letter to your return that says you are making an election under paragraph 249(4)(b).

Where shares of a corporation are transferred to an estate because of a death, there is no acquisition of control. In general, this also applies when the transfer is made to a related person. As a result, there is no deemed tax year-end and no tax return is required to be filed. For more information, see subsection 256(7).

**Notes:**
- The acquisition of control under subsection 256(9) of a corporation is usually deemed to occur at the beginning of the day on which the acquisition takes place. However, the particular time of day that the acquisition of control took place will be recognized if the corporation makes an election under subsection 256(9). To elect under subsection 256(9), include a note with your return for the tax year ending immediately before control was acquired and enter the hours and minutes that specify the time of day at line 065.
- The deeming rule does not apply when determining the status of a corporation as a small business corporation or a Canadian-controlled private corporation at the time of the transaction that caused the change of control. The status of the corporation will not change until the actual time of the acquisition.

## Line 066 – Is the date on line 061 a deemed tax year-end according to subsection 249(3.1)?

If at any time a corporation becomes or stops being a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) for any reason other than an acquisition of control, subsection 249(3.1) provides that the tax year of the corporation is deemed to end immediately before that change. You do not need the minister's approval for the changed tax year.

File a return for the tax year that ends immediately before the change. The next tax year is deemed to start on the date that the corporation type changed, and the corporation can choose any tax year-end within the next 53 weeks.

If the change occurs up to seven days after the end of an established tax year and there has not been an acquisition of control and the corporation has not become or stopped being a CCPC, within those seven days the corporation can choose to extend the tax year up to the time the change occurred. In this case, attach a letter to your return that says you are making an election under paragraph 249(3.1)(c).

## Line 067 – Is the corporation a professional corporation that is a member of a partnership?

A professional corporation is a corporation that carries on the professional practice of an accountant, dentist, lawyer, (including a notary in the province of Quebec), medical doctor, veterinarian, or chiropractor.

### Billed-basis accounting for professional corporations

For tax years that begin after March 21, 2017, professional corporations are not allowed to use billed-basis accounting anymore. That is, they are no longer permitted to elect to exclude the value of work in progress at the end of a tax year from business income for that year.

As a transitional measure, where a corporation has elected to use billed-basis accounting for its last tax year that begins before March 22, 2017, the inclusion of work in progress is phased into income as follows:
- for the first tax year of the corporation that begins after March 21, 2017, 20% of the lesser of the cost and the fair market value of work in progress will be taken into account for determining the value of inventory held by the business under the ITA
- this rate will increase progressively to reach 100% at the end of the fifth tax year that begins after March 21, 2017

## Line 070 – Is this the first year of filing after incorporation?

If you answer yes, you have to file Schedule 24, First-Time Filer After Incorporation, Amalgamation, or Winding-up of a Subsidiary into a Parent, with your return. If you do not file Schedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed. See chapters 2 and 3 for other schedules you may have to attach to your return.

**Note:** The tax year of a new corporation cannot be longer than 53 weeks from the date it was incorporated.

If this is your first year of filing after incorporation, you must tick yes at line 030 and complete lines 031 to 038.

## Line 071 – Is this the first year of filing after amalgamation?

If you answer yes, you have to file Schedule 24, First-Time Filer After Incorporation, Amalgamation, or Winding-up of a Subsidiary into a Parent, with your return. If you do not file Schedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed.

**Note:** The tax year of a new corporation cannot be longer than 53 weeks from the date it was amalgamated.

If this is your first year of filing after amalgamation, you must tick yes at line 030 and complete lines 031 to 038.

## Line 072 – Has there been a wind-up of a subsidiary under section 88 during the current tax year?

If you answer yes, you have to file Schedule 24, First-Time Filer After Incorporation, Amalgamation, or Winding-up of a Subsidiary into a Parent, with your return. If you do not file Schedule 24, the processing of your return may be delayed.

**Reference:** IT-126, Meaning of "Winding up"

## Line 076 – Is this the final tax year before amalgamation?

Predecessor corporations filing their last returns have to answer yes to this question on their final returns.

When two or more corporations amalgamate, each of the predecessor corporations has to file a return for the period ending immediately before the effective date of amalgamation. The effective date of amalgamation is governed by corporate law. Generally, the effective date is on the certificate of amalgamation or the letters patent of amalgamation.

**Note:** The CRA cannot accept returns filed for the period ending just before a date that is not the effective date of amalgamation.

**Reference:** S4–F7–C1, Amalgamations of Canadian Corporations

## Line 078 – Is this the final return up to dissolution?

You have to answer yes if you have already permanently dissolved your corporation with the incorporating authority and you are filing your final return for a tax year ending on the date of dissolution. You will find the date of dissolution on the articles of dissolution.

The responsible representative has to get a clearance certificate from the tax services office before distributing any of the corporation's property under his or her control. By getting the certificate, the responsible representative will avoid being personally liable for the unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties. Include Schedule 100, Balance Sheet Information, with the final return, which shows how the assets were distributed.

**Note:** If you want to dissolve your corporation, you should send an application for dissolution to the government body that governs the affairs of your corporation.

Once the corporation has been dissolved, you should consult Form RC145, Request to Close Business Number Program Accounts, to determine whether you need to complete that form and send the CRA the articles of dissolution. Otherwise, the CRA considers that the corporation still exists, and it will have to file a return even if there is no tax payable.

Once the corporation is dissolved, any refunds to which the corporation would be entitled revert to the Crown and cannot normally be issued to the corporation or its representatives unless the charter is reinstated.

If the corporation was not involuntarily dissolved and the charter is not reinstated, a refund can be issued if all returns have been filed up to the date of dissolution for all revenue lines (T2, GST, and other levies returns) and the refund is issued to one of the following:
- the sole shareholder of the corporation
- a legal representative of the corporation when there are multiple shareholders

If these conditions are not met, the refund will remain with the Crown.

**References:** Subsection 159(2); IC82-6, Clearance Certificate

## Line 079 – If an election was made under section 261

If the return is not reported in Canadian currency, indicate the functional currency used.

Corporations resident in Canada throughout the tax year can elect to report in a functional currency, except for:
- investment corporations
- mortgage investment corporations
- mutual fund corporations

A functional currency is a currency of a country other than Canada that is both:
- a qualifying currency (currently, the British pound, the euro, the Australian dollar, the U.S. dollar, and the Japanese yen)
- the primary currency in which the taxpayer keeps its records and books of account for financial reporting purposes for the tax year
